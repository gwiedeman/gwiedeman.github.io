### Web Archives at UAlbany

* Archive-It partner
* Crawling albany.edu since 2013
* NY State Politics since 2016
    * Extension of physical collecting
* Some Experimenting
* No known active use<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

### Web Archives at UAlbany

* We have and want to build collections on NY State politics and public policy
* Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy
* No real existing relationship
* Faculty member who researches right-wing extremist networks on the web
    * wget --recursive and TBs of raw html
    * Trouble with some sites

---

### Appraising a Racist Website

* Purposely document conflicting views
    * Conservative Party of NYS
    * Ernest Van Den Haag
* Listening to at-risk groups
* Is conservatism underdocumented?
    * Maybe in quantity, but not in research value
    * Content-wise this is garbage
    * Underdocumented records are not on the web
* SPLC already adding to Wayback
* Can directly aid research

---

### Crawling a Racist Website

* Recursively appending garbage to URLs?
* Millions of docs
* Bad wordpress plugins?
* obfuscation or incompetence?

### Things to think about

* Do they sell ads? Am I funding them?
    * Turn off add blocker
    * Is scopeing them effective?
* Why is it appending numbers as params?

### Breaking things

* Crawls didn't get user activity pages
* Tried to crawl just that section
* Suddenly required login for major parts of site<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
    * is that good?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    </br>
* "I might have made your research data impossible to get, but here's a WARC you don't know how to use."<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

---

### Web Archives and Oppositional Collecting

* I think there are underdocumented things
    * How racist or other ideas affect political power?
    * Are these records on the public web?
* Web Archives are extremely limited for this type of collecting
* Broader questions about collecting and power
