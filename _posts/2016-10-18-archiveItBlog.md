abstract: Guest post for the Archive-It Blog. In recent years many archives have expanded to preserve the web among other formats in their traditional collecting areas. Yet, unlike traditional formats, the best way to make web archives available to researchers is not with boxes and call numbers, but in their original environment â€” an Internet-connected web browser. This post discusses how at the University at Albany, SUNY, we are providing minimal access to this new type of archival material together with other formats that originated with the same creators.
