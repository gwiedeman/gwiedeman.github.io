abstract: 'Archival Values: Essays in Honor of Mark A. Greene is an archetypal Festschrift with 23 essays on each of the 11 Society of American Archivists Core Values of Archivists. This is primarily a book about archival professionalism, as Scott Cline’s framing essay offers the values as "integral to the archival endeavor" and the SAA Publications Board selected it as the fourth of SAA’s annual “One Book, One Profession” series. The book features some particularly standout works that will help both graduate students and veteran archivists better understand some of the more cutting-edge ideas that are reshaping how archivists think of themselves and their work. However, the traditional format and conservative genre can be a bit problematic and may undermine the effort and limit its potential readership.'
