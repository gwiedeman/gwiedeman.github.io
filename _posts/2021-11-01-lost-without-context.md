Abstract:

The problem of representing context for archival materials in digital asset management
systems (DAMS) has been noted - and lamented - for as long as digital representations of archives have
been online. This white paper discusses the nature of this challenge, explores why it remains so thorny,
and provides examples of where archival access systems have been successful in representing context.
With hopes of moving the conversation forward, we provide a set of principles for representing archives
in context that can be implemented regardless of the particular systems employed. These principles
are based on archival standards and software best practices, and can be summarized as six ideas:

1. Create space for deep conversations with all stakeholders and so that everyone understands
foundational requirements.
2. Value archival context and design systems so that contextual relationships between records are
explicit and clear.
3. Leverage the power (and cost savings) of aggregate digitization and description when
appropriate.
4. Be consistent about modelling relationships between an analog object (if relevant), a digital
object, and the description of the archival record.
5. Use persistent identifiers.
6. Lean on widely-used standards, systems, and solutions.

Finally, we call on standards-making bodies to introduce a more robust data model for archival
representation that includes both the description of archival contents and contexts.
