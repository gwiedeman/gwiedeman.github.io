## Systems Principles

* Use one descriptive system (archival description!)
* Build networks of systems and limit their use to what they are really good at
* Computers donâ€™t preserve bits, people preserve bits

---

### Early Systems at UAlbany

* Paper finding aids, abstracts, MARC
* 2000: Static HTML files
* 2000s: Collections Manager (accessions)
* 2004: Photo Manager
* 2008: LUNA for digital assets
* 2010: Began EAD with XSLT stylesheets
* 2014: Wrote XTF into CLIR Hidden Collections Grant
    * Archivist got time to experiment

---

## Current Systems

* 2016: [ArchivesSpace](https://aspace.library.albany.edu/)
    * [Find-It](https://archives.albany.edu/find-it/)
    * [asInventory](https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/asInventory)
* 2019: [ArcLight](https://archives.albany.edu/description/)

## More details

* [Documentation Site](https://archives.albany.edu)
* [Github](https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives)

### Challanges

* Usability
* Maintenance
* Repositories are complex
* High technical bar for traditional tasks

---

## How?

* Permanent staff with freedom to experiment
* Admin access (or close to it)
* On-campus data center
* Grants and systems support and turnover
* Keep tools simple
* Acting as "Product Owner"

---

## Lowering barriers

* [EmpireADC](https://www.empireadc.org/) Consortium
* [staticAid](https://hillelarnold.com/blog/2016/02/a-static-html-site-generator-for-archival-description/)
* [ArchivesSnake](https://github.com/archivesspace-labs/ArchivesSnake)
* Respositories are the worst
