### My experience with EAD

* Learned technology by hand-encoding EAD
* Built tools to work with EAD
* Work with ASpace, ArcLight, Hyrax/Samvera
* Manage traditional archival processes
* EmpireADC advisor

---

### The Promise of EAD

> "An encoding standard would guarantee that the machine-readable finding aids created today would be usable tomorrow!"

Daniel V. Pitti, "The Berkeley Finding Aid Project," 1994 [http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/dvp4c/arlpap.htm](http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/dvp4c/arlpap.htm)

---

### One Common Format

* Structure your archival description
* Preservation format, future-proof
* Easily move data between systems

We need to give up on this dream <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

### Archival systems still limited

* ArchivesSpace and other successful tools
* Front-end usability still a problem
* No archival system to manage digital objects
* Funding and sustainability are challeneges

As the data structure standard, EAD defines how systems work with archival description <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

### Hard to build systems with EAD

* Variability
	* `<unitdate>` within `<unittitle>`
* Mixed content
	* `<languagenote>`, `<title>`, `<date>`, etc.
* Designed with document in mind
* EAD3 is incremental improvement
	* `<languagedeclaration>`
	* `<unitdatestructured>`

---

### EAD is a Lossy Medium

* "Migration" problems
* More effective to pull directly from systems

### EmpireADC from Archipelago to ArcLight

### Records in Context


---

### From XML format to Data Model

<div class="fLeft">
	<ul>
		<li>Standardize data structure, not format</li>
		<li>Accept that description will live in multiple formats and systems</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="fRight">
	<img class="whitebg" src="img/dataModel.gif" />
</div>

### Data Model: A Set of Rules

---

### Thinking in Abstractions



---

* Data Structure Standard (MARC)
> "define what elements of information are contained in the components of an information system."

* Information Systems Standard (Z39.50)
> "define the roles of and interrelationships among each component  within  the  overall  system"

["Report of the Working Group on Standards for Archival Description," American Archivist 52, no. 4 (1989): 453-453.](https://doi.org/10.17723/aarc.52.4.qn5515l3671v1517)

---

### Serialization is easier

* Let the developers deal with that
* Rely on conventions
	* EAD2002, EAD3, JSON, Spreadsheets, Linked data triples
	* Use of EAD already relies on conventions
	* `<extent units="">32</extent>`

---

### More inclusive approach

* Lowers cost of systems and intergration
* Allows new possibilities
	* Google Forms
	* Spreadsheets
* Allows broader participation
