### How do we manage large volumes

* Aggregations
* *respect des fonds*
* National Archives
* "[finding aids](https://archives.albany.edu/description/repositories/all)"

### Extensible Processing

Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner, "[More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing](
https://doi.org/10.17723/aarc.68.2.c741823776k65863
)," *American Archivist* Vol. 68, No. 2 (2005)
* No Detailed Processing vs. Minimal Processing/MPLP
* Creative approaches to scale are fundamental to archives
* We will never have enough resources
* Processing is resource management

---

### Handling Scale with our Principles

* Establishing baseline processing for everything
* User-based reason for adding additional description
    * Request statistics
    * Web usage statistics
* Avoid granular preservation interventions in most cases
* Don't describe containers
* Make the robots do the work

---

### Digitization on Demand

* Empower users to make requests
* Appraisal by direct use
* Use cheap digitization methods
    * Sheet feeders!
* [Connect digital objects with description](https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/wp988k33r)
    * Metadata is most costly part of digitization
* David A. Bearman and Richard H. Lytle, "[The Power of the Principle of Provenance ](https://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/11231)," *Archivaria* 21 (1985)
