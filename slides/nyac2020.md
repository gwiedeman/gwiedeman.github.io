### Archival Aggregation

* Bring together description across repositories
* Enable discovery in new ways

## Didn't we already do this? <!-- .element: style="font-size: 77px;" -->

### EAD and Regional Aggregators

### We keep reinventing the wheel

* Lack of sustainable efforts <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Based on specific outputs or tools <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Published guides
	* Catalog records and Bibliographic networks
	* EAD and XTF
	* --> Linked Data <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### We need to stop combining description storage and display 

* "Finding Aid" is not a helpful concept

---

## We need a common data model

Will allow us to present description in different views, formats, outputs as they change over time

---

## "Migration issues"

(These are usually data issues) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

* "Does this tool import [EAD, MODS, etc.]?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Giving up on standard formats somewhat <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* The data model is more important <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

---

### What is a common data model?

* Abstract
	* not tied to any specific format or system
* Strict
	* compartmentalizes information in sets of elements
* Structures
	* defines the relationships between elements

---

#### Portland Common Data Model (PCDM)

---

### No more of this nonsense

<img src="img/badData.png" alt="Image of poorly-encoded extent in EAD." />

[This is actually the first language example in the EAD tag library](https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/langmaterial.html) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

### ArchivesSpace Data Model

```
{
  "expression": "1927-2000",
  "begin": "1927",
  "end": "2000",
  "date_type": "inclusive",
  "label": "creation",
  "jsonmodel_type": "date"
}
```
```
{
  "number": "44.4",
  "portion": "whole",
  "extent_type": "cubic ft.",
  "jsonmodel_type": "extent"
}
```

---

#### You can still have narrative description

<div id="fLeft">
	<img src="img/aspaceLang1.png" alt="Example of language notes in ArchivesSpace before and after v2.7.0. The update allows for both structured and unstructured description." />
	Before v2.7.0
</div>
<div id="fRight"> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	<img src="img/aspaceLang2.png" alt="The basic PCDM model" />
	After v2.7.0
</div>



---

### There are good ideas in RiC!

* Description as a linked graph
* Function authorities

I wish it tried to do less and the URIs were an afterthought.

---

### There are good ideas from description theory

* Current practices fail to document the impact of archivists and their decisions on collections
* Michelle Light and Tom Hyry, ["Colophons and Annotations: New Directions for the Finding Aid," The American Archivist 65(2) (Fall/Winter 2002)](https://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.65.2.l3h27j5x8716586q)

### What this could look like

<img src="img/exampleDataModel.png" alt="An example of what an archival data model could look like.">

---

### Common archival data model

* Will not solve all problems
* Makes everything more cost effective
* Easier to make aggregation efforts sustainable
* Allows for multiple displays/formats/outputs
* Gives more archivists a say
* Can empower small repositories without big tools
	* Lydia Lucas, ["Efficient Finding Aids: Developing a System for Control of Archives and Manuscripts," The American Archivist 44(1) (Winter 1981)](https://americanarchivist.org/doi/abs/10.17723/aarc.44.1.3u63r01w75m5p268)
