## To use MPLP: The False Choice

* The spirit of MPLP is freedom to choose
* No more monolithic solutions
* Honest look at resources

---

## Processing is Resource Management

* Arrangement, Description, Preservation is costly
* We will never have enough resources
* Must ask, "How will this effort help researchers?"
* Detailed Processing is often Lazy <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

## Extensible Processing

* Baseline minimum of access
* Focus on meeting legal requirements
* Can manage restrictions during requests
* Prioritization based on real use, not imagined importance

## Give up things that don't enable use

* Avoid arrangement
* Preservation interventions only when necessary
* Focus on effective description

"How will this effort help researchers?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

This is Hard <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

## Pragmatic Examples

* Melissa McMullen: Managing complex restrictions
* Jon Palmer: Processing at small historical library <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Erik Stolarski: Reading Room Collections <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Ben Covell: Different processing within one collection <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
