## Am I a developer?

* I end up writing code for large part of my job <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* I developed our website, write small desktop apps, now writing Rails apps <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* I don't have to learn and write applications for outside processes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* If I wrote most of our tools I would be a bad archivist <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* I'm not always in-line with professional best practices <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

 
I'm a really bad developer <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Do you need developer skills to be a good archivist?

* Allows you to be active rather than passive use of existing tools
* Helps understand systems architectures
* Eases/Speeds migrations
* Small workflow tools can be really valuable

## Technology is not the Core of our Mission

* Archivists collect
* Archivists appraise
* Archivists preserve
* Archivists describe
* Archivists make records accessible

---

## Technology is an Amplifier

* Scripts collect over network transfers or disk images
* Command line tools or scripts <i>enable</i> appraisal at scale
* Digital repositories <i>eases</i> preservation planning
* Collections Management Systems <i>support</i> description
* Web applications make records <i>more</i> accessible

## Not every archivist is a digital archivist

## Every archives needs a digital archivist
