Hopefully this rather long-winded description helps document our processes and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, my strategy was to import everything twice. Once we got most of our data into ASpace, I let our staff have a free run of the data to get comfortable with the application. We maintained our previous data stores as masters, and staff could create, edit, and delete ASpace data as much as they wanted. When we were done testing and I was comfortable with all the migration scripts, we cleared out all the data and made a clean import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clean-up-ead-files-for-the-archivesspace-importer&quot;&gt;Clean-up EAD files for the ArchivesSpace importer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;importFix.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step one was getting all of our EAD data reformatted so they would all easily import into ASpace. I wrote &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;importFix.py&lt;/code&gt; to make duplicate copies of all of our EAD XML files while stripping out and cleaning any issues that I found would cause errors during import. An example issue was that ASpace didn’t want extent units stored in an attribute like 
  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;extent unit=&quot;cubic ft.&quot;&amp;gt;21&amp;lt;/extent&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Instead, it wanted &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;extent&amp;gt;21 cubic ft.&amp;lt;/extent&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had been using an internal semantic ID system, but we wanted to get rid of these and rely on the ASpace ref_IDs instead, so the script also removes all the @id attributes in &lt;c01&gt;, &lt;c02&gt;, etc.&lt;/c02&gt;&lt;/c01&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also fix these issues with a plugin that customized how ASpace imports the files. Alex Duryee has spoken on this at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexduryee/saa-aspace-demo&quot;&gt;SAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexduryee/beyondthebasics&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. I was already much more comfortable with Python and lxml, so this was faster for a one-off import process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we had employed a lot of rule-based validation to ensure standardization. There were other issues, like ASpace understood that 1988-03-30/1981-01-01 was an invalid date, but our validation script did not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the script also identified components with empty &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;unittitle&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, etc., so I could get a list of these issues prior to import. Once I had identified the most common problems, this was much easier than having background jobs keep failing halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a tedious process with lots of trial and error that took almost 2 complete days. I had to re-import a bunch of times, so I wrote &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deleteRepoRecords.py&lt;/code&gt; to delete all resource records in ASpace (obviously use cautiously).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feedback from ASpace on import issues can be really frustrating. It does not give you feedback on the EAD file that was the culprit, but points you to the new native ASpace record that was never actually created. You have to dig a bit in the log to find the EAD filename. Since I has stripped out our IDs, I was only left with the ASpace ref_id which is not helpful at all in finding individual components among our EAD jungle, so I had to rely on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;unittitle&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;unitdate&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; strings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll see feedback like, “there’s an issue in note[7].” It takes a while to figure out that note[7] means &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;physdesc&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We only have one real import incompatibility with  ASpace, and that was only one EAD file where 7,800 lines of the 13,000 line file was one gigantic &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;chronlist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. ASpace rightly denied this garbage, so we just pulled it out of the finding aid and maybe it will become a part of a web exhibit some day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We still had a some messy data when you checked the controlled values lists, but these were few enough that it was easier to identify and clean these issues after the migration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of this process, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;importFix.py&lt;/code&gt; allowed us to keep creating and maintaining our EAD files in our current systems, but also let me quickly create ASpace-friendly versions when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-repeat-yourself&quot;&gt;Don’t Repeat Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/archives_tools&quot;&gt;aspace Python Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wrote the delete resources script I discovered that working with the API is awesome, but I was also repeatedly calling the same API requests. There is no complete Python library for the ArchivesSpace API, so most people make calls manually with &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt;. Artefactual labs also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artefactual-labs/agentarchives&quot;&gt;basic library&lt;/a&gt; for this, but it doesn’t do a lot for you and still involves manually dealing with a lot of JSON in a way that I didn’t find intuitive. Basically, I wanted to iterate though the ASpace data as easily as lxml loops though XML data. This often involves multiple API calls for a single function.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the course of the migration I started writing a bunch of functions that manage the API behind the scenes. This was I can quickly iterate though collections with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getResources()&lt;/code&gt;, collection arrangement with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getTree()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getChildren()&lt;/code&gt; and even find a collection by its identifier with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getResourceID()&lt;/code&gt;, or a location by its title string with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;findLocations()&lt;/code&gt;. Its also handy to have some blank objects at your fingertips, like with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;makeArchObj()&lt;/code&gt;, so you can create new archival objects without knowing exactly what JSON ASpace needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also some debugging tools I use all time. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pp()&lt;/code&gt; pretty prints an object to the console as JSON, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fields()&lt;/code&gt; lists all the keys in an object, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;serializeOutput()&lt;/code&gt; writes objects to your filesystem as .json files.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easydict/&quot;&gt;easydict&lt;/a&gt; to make objects out of the JSON, so you can call it with dot notation (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print collection.title&lt;/code&gt;). Writing this library enabled me from rewriting the same code, or finding that script I used last week to steal some lines from. Its really cool to be able to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  from archives_tools import aspace as AS
    
  session = AS.getSession()
  repo = &quot;2&quot;
    
  for collection in AS.getResources(session, repo, &quot;all&quot;):
  	if collection.title = &quot;David Baldus Papers&quot;:
  		collection = AS.makeDate(collection, 1964-11, 2001-03)
  		post = AS.postResource(session, repo, collection)
  		print (post)
    		
  &amp;gt; 200
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats here. There are a bunch of decisions you make while writing these that I kind of made arbitrarily. It’s probably more complex than it has to be. Ideally, this would be more a a communally-driven effort based on a wider set of needs and perspectives. The code is completely open, so if nothing else, I guess this could provide an example of what a Python library for ASpace might look like. I’m going to try and complete the documentation soon, and if anyone has suggestions I’d really like to hear them. If the community moves to a different approach, I’ll work to update all of our processes to match the consensus, since it will be better than what I can come up with on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;import-collection-level-records&quot;&gt;Import collection-level records&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;migrateCollections.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before ArchivesSpace, we used a custom “CMS” system for collection management and accessioning. We think it’s over 15 years old, and the only way to get data out is directly from the database tables which looked like they were copied from some other system and were overtly complicated and often repeated data. Moreover, the only way to view entire records was to go into edit mode where you could easily overwrite data. If you picked an accession number for a new accession that was already taken, it would just override the old record (!!!). Overall it was a pain to enter information in the system and over time the department slowly stopped updating all but the most necessary fields. Yet, this system had the only total listing of all collections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we found that as we got more and more of our archival description into EAD, we needed an automated way to push this data into our Drupal-driven website, so I pulled a master collection list out of this collection management system, updated and fixed it and just dumped it into a spreadsheet. For each collection it had a normalized name, listed if there was an EAD or HTML finding aid, and had an extent, inclusive date, and abstract for everything not in EAD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we’ve been making great strides in getting collection-level records for everything, almost 1/3 on our collections sill only had accession records in the old system, and a row in this spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet has been our master collection list and a key part of the backend of &lt;a href=&quot;http://library.albany.edu/archive&quot;&gt;our public access system&lt;/a&gt; (not recommended). ArchivesSpace now allows us to replace this setup by pulling all of this information directly from the API.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, with this spreadsheet I could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/&quot;&gt;a Python library for .xslx files&lt;/a&gt; to import some basic resource records into ASpace. While they wouldn’t be DACS-compliant, we could still export this basic data to our public access system, and link them to accession records we’ll import later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;migrateCollections.py&lt;/code&gt; iterates though the spreadsheet and uses the aspace library to post new resource records in ASpace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;migrating-accessions&quot;&gt;Migrating Accessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;migrateAccessions.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For accessions I asked the Library’s awesome database person Krishna for help. Our old “CMS” was a .asp web application which, from what I can tell, used an old SQL server for its database. I needed something that I could loop though with Python so I asked him to export some CSVs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once he made the first export we noticed some problems. First there were a lot of commas in some of the fields, so we had to use a different delimiter. The other problem was there was a bunch of carriage returns that use the same character as the csv new line, so we had to escape all these prior to the export. I tried fixing it with a Python script by counting the number of fields in each row and piecing it back together humpty-dumpty-style, but I never want to do something that frustrating again. Luckily with a little time, Krishna was able to escape them before export and use pipes (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) as the delimiter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I was able to loop through the table with all the accessions, I met with Jodi and Melissa, some of our other archivists, to identify which fields were still held useful data and how to map them to ASpace accession records. Honestly, we threw out half the data because it was useless, but we were able to reclaim all the accession dates, descriptions, and extents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had a handful of issues that had to be edited manually. Even though the system returned an error if you forgot to enter an accession number, there were a bunch of records without numbers or records without numbers. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;checkAccessions.py&lt;/code&gt; identified these issues, but we had to go look at each record and try to parse out what happened. The good thing was the data did include a last updated timestamp, which helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course the first time I tried this I opened the CSV file in Excel it unhelpfully decided to reformat all of the timestamps and drop all the trailing zeros. Good thing I kept a backup file. Since it was only a handful I ended up doing the edits in a text editor, just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cool thing was that the collection IDs were really standardized, so we could easily match them up with the resource records we just created. We just had to convert APAP-312 to apap312, which is a piece of cake with Python’s string methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aspace library really came in handy here. Two functions, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;makeExtent()&lt;/code&gt; and  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;makeDate()&lt;/code&gt; just add extents and dates to any ASpace JSON object. This worked with accessions just as it did with resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extent was just an uncontrolled string field. Considering this, we had used the field very consistently, but of course there were a bunch of typos or oddly worded unit descriptions. I cleaned up the vast bulk of these issues with Python’s string methods, but there were still some “long-tail” issues that didn’t seem to be worth spending hours on. After all, we haven’t needed real machine-readable accession extents yet, and its not publicly-visible data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now I just allowed a new extent type “uncontrolled,” and threw the whole field in the number field. We can just fix these one by one as we come across them. I guess I could have dumped the CSV into OpenRefine, but I can also come back later and export a new CSV with the API if we need to clean these up further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;migrateAccessions.py&lt;/code&gt;, we had accession records and collection descriptions in the same place for the first time. I was really wonderful seeing those Related Accessions and Related Resources links pop up in ASpace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;locations&quot;&gt;Locations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;	migrateLocations.py
	exportContainers.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locations turned out to be the trickiest part of the migration, because our local practices really conflicted with how ASpace manages locations. Theory-wise ASpace does this much better and eventually our practices will improve after the migration, but I had to do some hacky stuff to get ASpace to work with our locations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, in ASpace 1.5+ containers are separated out and managed separately from archival description and connected to both location and description records with URI link. This is great because it lets us describe records independently from how they are managed physically. The newer ASpace versions also let you do some really cool things like calculate extents if you have good data and also supports barcoding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In ASpace collections don’t have locations. How can they, since archival description is really an intangible layer of abstraction that just refers to boxes and folders? In ASpace, collections (or any other description records) are linked to Top Containers (boxes) which are linked to locations. Long-term this is great, since it lets us manage the intellectual content of a collection differently from its physical content.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, this poses a very practical problem for us. Our old “CMS” had only one location text field per collection, so we really only have collection-level locations. We’ve never really had a problem with our location records because we have really awesome on-site storage. It also helps that most of our staff has been here a long time, and at least generally knows where most collections are anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The location field we had was really messy. This is one extreme real-world example:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  H-16-3-1/H-16-2-3,(last shelf has microfilm and CDs with images used for LUNA); 
  G-8-1-1/G-8-2-1; G-17-3-2/G-17-3-1; G-17-4-1/G-17-4-7; G-10-4-1/G-10-4-3;
  G-10-5-1/G-10-5-8;C-12-2-1/C-12-2-5; C-12-1-2/-12-1-3; SB 17 - o-15 (bound
  copies of Civil Service Leader digitized by Hudson Micro and returned in 
  2013, bound and unbound copies of The Public Sector, 1978-1998, digitized
  and returned in 2015, unbound copies of The Work Force, 1998 through 2012, 
  also digitized); Cold 1-1 - 1-4, E-1-1, A-1-7 - A-1-8, A-1-5 - A-1-7,
  A-1-9, A-1-8, A-1-8 - A-1-9, A-5-1 - A-5-2, A-5-2 - A-5-3, A-4-9 - A-5-1,
  A-6-5, A-5-5, A-6-4 - A-6-5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that collection has a bunch of top containers, how do I assign that mess to them? Well this collection in particular is currently being, well, &lt;em&gt;reworked&lt;/em&gt;, but for everything else we had to standardize the data into one format, basically:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  G-4-2-3/G-4-2-7 (whatever note here); J-3-3-5 (second location here); I-7-3-6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then one of our awesome graduate students, Ben Covell, learned &lt;a href=&quot;http://openrefine.org/&quot;&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/a&gt; in about a hour and cleaned up all the data in less than a day. (Part of the solution always seems to be having great grad students)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we decided it wasn’t worth it to go through every box in the archives to get individual shelf coordinates. Thus, we had two options, either use a separate system for shelf lists, or hack ASpace to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried and failed to get ASpace to accept multiple locations per box, which seems like it really shouldn’t be allowed. You can actually have a top container linked to multiple shelves, but it won’t let you then link those boxes to description records.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASpace does let you have previous locations though, but it requires an end date, and the location record to have a temporary label. We decided to have a temporary “collection_level” label and setting the end date to 2999-01-01, and hope that we weren’t creating an insurmountable Y3K problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing it this way meant a lot of work with the API, because we had to find every top container assigned to each collection, translate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;G-17-3-8&lt;/code&gt; to a ASpace location record, find that record, update that location record to be temporary, and update the top_container record to add each location. This is exactly what &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;migrateLocations.py&lt;/code&gt; does, and with the library it only takes 200 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that means if a collection-level location was &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;C-24-2-1/C-24-3-8&lt;/code&gt; (16 shelves), every box in that collection (probably about 40-50 boxes) would be linked to each of those 16 locations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For larger collections, this would be a bit unwieldy, so the plan is to list individual shelves for larger collections now, and do the rest over time. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exportContainers.py&lt;/code&gt; helps with this. It makes a .xlsx spreadsheet for each collection that lists every top container and its URI. So we have a directory of spreadsheet files for each collection like apap101.xlsx. We can list the shelf coordinates for each box in that spreadsheet in our same format (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;K-2-2-3&lt;/code&gt;) and use the API to update each top container record over time. Now whenever we’re working with a collection we can fix this problem one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, ASpace comes with some really cool features like container profiles and shelf profiles, but they’re not mandatory. We decided it wasn’t worth it yet to measure each shelf, but we hope to do this over time in the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, migrating locations “the right way” would have taken months and months of effort and involved every staff member in the department. Instead, I was able to basically do it myself with a little help in about a week. We might run into a problem if updates to ASpace changes how the application handles these records, but even in that worst-case scenario we can just export all our incompatible locations with the API before upgrading and use a separate shelf list system. Our data will even be a lot better too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We really didn’t have the option to bring in Lyrasis to do workshops for our staff on how to use ASpace. This is going to be the primary medium for our department to create metadata and make our holdings available, so they need to be comfortable with it, and switching everyone over to a whole new system without any formal prep is a lot to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way I find to learn a tool is to get some hands-on experience and try and break it to see where the boundaries are. Migrating all our data twice, not only lowered the stakes for the first import, but it gave us a lot of time with a fully-running ArchivesSpace with a lot of realistic test data. I opened it up to the our department and encouraged them to make new resources and accessions, delete things, and generally try test their boundaries and get comfortable. I pointed them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/OK%20State%20U%20Using%20ArchivesSpace.pdf&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/UNO_ArchivesSpace_Walkthroughs_2015.pdf&quot;&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; shared by the SAA Collection Management Tools Section, and they also said there’s a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=archviesspace&quot;&gt;screencasts on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; that really helped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, ASpace is very intuitive, and easy to use if you comfortable working with web applications. Our department has taken to it fairly quickly, and I don’t think more formal training would of helped much. Having a really good sandbox and dedicating real time to experimenting with it is definitely key.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also still working on establishing best practices for use and documentation for our students. I think this is actually a bigger hurdle than leaning the tool itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-satellite-tools&quot;&gt;Building Satellite Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best reason for implementing ArchivesSpace isn’t necessarily its basic functionally of creating and managing archival description. ASpace’s open architecture means that essentially all the data in the system can be read or updated with the API. This is not only for automating changes, but it also allows us to use other tools to interact with our data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other really cool thing is that the ASpace API is backed by a data model. This way it closely defines its acceptable data, and rejects anything outside of its parameters. I’ve found that this is makes life so much easier than say, managing your data in XML, since it has the effect of making your data much more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If ASpace doesn’t do something the way you like, you can just use a different tool to interact with your ASpace data. This way, ASpace can really support workflows that embrace the separation-of-concerns principle. Here ASpace is at the center of an open archives ecosystem, and you can have smaller, impermanent tools to fill specific functions really well. Often, a modular system like this can be easier to maintain, as in the future you can replace these smaller tools one-by-one as they become obsolete, rather than the daunting task of one huge migration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of this is built upon the work Hillel Arnold and Patrick Galligan have done at the Rockefeller Archive Center. They wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/as-cors&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that lets you work with the API from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.rockarch.org/?p=1610&quot;&gt;single HTML page with JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. They used this to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/find-it&quot;&gt;Find-it&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.rockarch.org/?p=1621&quot;&gt;simple text field to return locations for ASpace ref_ids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find-It solved a key problem for us as one of the only things our old “CMS” did really well was that you could type in “Crone” and quickly get shelf locations for the Michelle Crone Papers. Our other archivists were asking for something similar in ArchivesSpace, and didn’t like they you had to look through three different records to get this information in ASpace. Yet, the odd way I did our locations posed some problems. Ref_ids would also work, but we needed to return locations for top containers assigned to resources as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With my hacky JavaScript skills (and some help from Slack) I set it up to also return locations for resources using the search API endpoint and the id_0 field. Using the search API made me realize that I could also make an API call that returns a keyword search for resources. The search returns links to the Resource page in ASpace and XTF as well, which makes Find-it a really quick first access point to our collections as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last request I got was for some way to access locations from resources with lower levels of description, so I was even able to call the resource tree and add links to lower levels if there are no instances. I just made find-it accept ids as a hash and these links just reloads the page with that lower-level ref_id. Overall it became a bit more complex than I was envisioning. Our fork is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/find-it&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I’d recommend starting with Rockefeller’s much cleaner version and using ours as more of an example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the single search bar on a white background was really boring, so I wrote a quick script that updates the background to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bing.com/gallery/&quot;&gt;Bing’s image of the day&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10639914/is-there-a-way-to-get-bings-photo-of-the-day&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/slides/img/findit.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another workflow issue we found was how tedious it could be to enter in individual containers for large accessions. Say we got a new collection of 50 boxes. ASpace makes you create each of these boxes, which is good, but very tedious. So I basically used the same framework as Find-it, figure our how to get ASpace to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/as-cors&quot;&gt;accept Cross-Origin post requests&lt;/a&gt;, and made a single-page box uploader. Now we can just list new boxes in these fields with our old-style shelf coordinates, and a bunch of JavaScript will create and assign all these new top containers to a resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/slides/img/boxes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last request I got from out staff was for creating container list inventories. We use undergraduate student assistants to do most of this data entry work, and we found that ASpace rapid data entry would require a good amount of training for our students who work few hours with a really high turnover rate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/asInventory&quot;&gt;some Python scripts&lt;/a&gt; to manage inventory listings with spreadsheets and the ASpace API. One parses a .xslx file and uploads file-level archival objects through the API. It will also take a bunch of access files and makes digital objects, places the files on our server and links them to archival objects. Another script reads an existing inventory back to a spreadsheet with all the relevant URIs so we can roundtrip these inventories for future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also envision this as a near-term solution, as its possible that we end up doing all this natively in ASpace in the future. The cool thing is that the ASpace API makes all these tools really easy and quick to make, and they solve real immediate problems for us. Yet, none of these tools are really essential for us, and if they become too difficult to manage, we can just drop them and move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;migration-days&quot;&gt;Migration Day(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ead-import&quot;&gt;EAD import&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;importFix.py
checkEAD.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When migration day came, we dumped the database, deleted the index, and started from scratch. I had Krishna export new CSVs from our old system with any updated records that were made since the previous export. By this point the plan was that migration scripts were done and tested and everything would go relatively seamlessly. I was hoping to get everything imported in a day or so, and minimize the downtime when staff were not allowed to make updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it came time for the EAD import, some recent EADs/updated had happened, and I still got 2 minor errors for about 630 EADs, so I didn’t actually get the Holy Grail of a perfect EAD import. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1963-0923&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1904-01/1903-07&lt;/code&gt; are not valid dates and ArchivesSpace, but these were easy fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I had noticed during the first time was than when you import a large amount of EADs, it takes the index awhile to catch up. ASpace still told me I had only 465 resources instead of 633, but that soon updated to 503. Yet, in about an hour I was still missing 29 collections. I assumed that this was still the index, but I quickly wrote checkEAD.py to see how many collections I could access though the API and I was still missing 29.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turned out that two import jobs had actually failed, but ASpace listed them as Complete for some reason. One issue was when we changed an ID and there was an eadid conflict, and the other issue was that I totally forgot about that huge &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;chronlist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that failed the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These were easy fixes but the lesson here is always test your imports and don’t trust the index.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The importing ended up taking most of the afternoon, so I discovered  my one-day migration plan was over-optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clean-resource-identifiers&quot;&gt;Clean Resource Identifiers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fixNam.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For collection identifiers we had been unsing the prefix &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nam_&lt;/code&gt; which is our OCLC repository ID or something, but we decided that this was overtly complex and not useful, so we decided to drop these late in the migration planning. While the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;importFix.py&lt;/code&gt; script was written to clear the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nam_&lt;/code&gt; prefix from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ead&amp;gt; @id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;eadid&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but I forgot to do this to the collection-level &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;unitid&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately I found out the hard way that this is what ASpace ends up using as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id_0&lt;/code&gt;, so I whipped up &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fixNam.py&lt;/code&gt; to strip this post-import rather than start the process over again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collection-level-spreadsheet-import&quot;&gt;Collection-level spreadsheet import&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;migrateCollections.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importing the basic collection-level records from the spreadsheet went fairly well. I realized that we also needed a normalized name for each collection in the resource records somewhere. For example, the “Office of Career and Professional Development Records” needed to be accessible somewhere as “Career and Professional Development, Office of; Records” so it would be alphabetized correctly in our front end. So, I added a few lines in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;migrateCollections.py&lt;/code&gt; that adds these normal names in the Finding Aid title field.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One annoying thing was that after I posted all the spreadsheet records, the index was a bit slow to update. I was all set to migrate the accessions, but to match them up with the resource records, I had to use the index to search for matching id_0 fields. However, within an hour or so suddenly ASpace had updated the index, and I was all set.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASpace told me I had 904 resources, which was curiously two more than we had in our master list. I assumed we failed to update our master list for two EADs and I imported them from the spreadsheet as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To confirm all the collections, I wrote &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;checkCollections.py&lt;/code&gt; to see what was up. It turned out that when we had updated that ID we still had a duplicate EAD file floating around, and another recent collection had an EAD file but was never entered in to the spreadsheet. These issues were easily fixed and all our collections were done.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accessions-and-locations&quot;&gt;Accessions and Locations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;migrateAccesions.py
checkAccessions.py
migrateLocations.py
checkLocations.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accessions and locations went easy without any issues. This time I wrote &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;checkAccessions.py&lt;/code&gt; to find all the accession issues from last time around, and everything went nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the locations had been updated since the last import, so &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;checkLocations.py&lt;/code&gt; verifies that these locations are indeed in ArchivesSpace, prior to running the import scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;export-scripts&quot;&gt;Export Scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;exportPublicData.py
lastExport.txt
exportConverter.py
staticPages.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we had migrated all of our data into ArchivesSpace, it was time to set up scheduled exports and connect everything with our public access system that consists of XTF and a sets of static pages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rockefeller’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/asExportIncremental&quot;&gt;asExportIncremental.py&lt;/a&gt; is a good source for how to do export EADs from ASpace incrementally. I followed the same basic idea, but omitted the MODS exports, and simplified it a bit into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exportPublicData.py&lt;/code&gt;. I integrated the same API call into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/archives_tools&quot;&gt;aspace library&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getResourcesSince()&lt;/code&gt; which takes a POSIX timestamp. Instead of using Pickle I just wrote the last export time to a text file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastExport.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASpace’s EAD exports didn’t exactly match up with what we had been using in XTF. You can change these exports with a plugin, but I found it easier to both make some changes in our XTF XSLT files, and write a quick &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exportConverter.py&lt;/code&gt; script with lxml.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exportPublicData.py&lt;/code&gt; loops though all the resources modified since the last export and only exports records that are published. Since we still have a bunch of resources that only have really simple collection-level descriptions, I didn’t want to export EADs and PDFs for these, so I just exported the important information to a pipe delimited CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I has always envisioned the ASpace API as completely replacing our spreadsheet that generates the static browse pages for our public access system. Yet, I didn’t want to 
export all that data over and over again, only make incremental updates like the EAD exports. Since my original static pages scripts were designed to loop though a spreadsheet, shifting to CSVs wasn’t very difficult. I also didn’t want to spend a lot of time changing things since we have some longer-term plans to export this data into a web framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exportPublicData.py&lt;/code&gt; updates this CSV data for modified collections as it exports EAD XML files. It then uses Python’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html&quot;&gt;subprocess&lt;/a&gt; module to call git commands and version these exports and pushes them to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/collections&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. It then copies new EAD files to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://meg.library.albany.edu:8080/archive/search?keyword=&amp;amp;browse-all=yes&quot;&gt;public XTF instance&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, it calls &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;staticPages.py&lt;/code&gt; to create all of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/eresources/static/apap.html&quot;&gt;static&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/eresources/static/alpha.html&quot;&gt;browse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/eresources/static/subjects.html&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had some encoding errors that were a pain to fix, so I ended up writing these scripts for only Python 3+.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These scripts are set up to run nightly, a few hours before XTF re-indexes. The result is that staff can make changes in ASpace, create new collections or subjects, and the new public access system pages will appear overnight, without any manual processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;timelines&quot;&gt;Timelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, how long did this all take? We got ArchivesSpace up an running on a server near the end of December 2016, really started the migration scripts during the start of February, and finished up everything on the second week of April. Most of the migration prep time spent was in February and the first week of March, and most of March was devoted to staff testing/experimenting and writing the smaller workflow tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final migration ended up taking about 2 1/2 workdays, which I’m fairly happy with. That was the only downtime we had when changes couldn’t be made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was also not committing a large department-wide effort. It was mostly me managing everything, and although it was probably my primary project during that period, I was also managing the regular day to day tasks of the University Archives: doing accessions and reference, managing students, and working with other offices on campus to transfer their permanent records, and also service and (not very much) scholarship. I’m also lucky to have two excellent graduate students in the University Archives this year, Ben Covell and Erik Stolarski. It really can’t be understated how having really bright and hardworking students enables us to do so much.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This timeframe is also a bit deceiving, as the real work started about 2 years ago when we worked to really standardize our descriptive data. A lot of the work we did back then really shortened up our timeline, as we didn’t have to do wholesale metadata cleanup before migrating. Our data still has some issues though, but ArchivesSpace has some features like the controlled values lists that can help fix some of our irregularities after migrating. The cool thing about this is that a lot of the clean up work can be distributed, as anyone in the department can easily make fixes whenever they see something.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we cut some corners on the data-side – particularly the locations. There are some long-term costs here as I decided to take lot of the labor required to straighten out all this data, and spread it out over time. I’m happy with this decision, as we have other competing priorities, like getting good collection-level records for everything, and overall increasing access to collections. We also could have put off the migration until some of our problems could be fixed, but there were significant maintenance costs to our old way of doing things that we really don’t have anymore. I’m hoping this frees us up to work on some of the more ambitious project we have planned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

His masterfully written tale is one of gross negligence, of crazed monsters masked as public servants, and of great tragedy. Baker expends great energy to reveal to the masses this stunning exposé: the purposeful destruction of invaluable public property by our most cherished institutions. Apparently, Baker tells us, our libraries have been secretly and systematically destroying all of their newspaper collections and much more. Yet when readers step back from Baker’s polemic and inquire about the availability of historic newspapers they will be shown to a microfilm machine or an online display. This, Baker insists, does not count. Here lies the crux of the matter, as Baker’s aggressive argument is a conflation of a number of issues surrounding the preservation of library and archival materials. These criticisms—some valid, some not—are mixed together indiscriminately by Baker who, despite his strong rhetoric, has essentially no understanding of the complexity and nuance that surrounds the strategy to preserve by microfilm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course librarians are not infallible, and it does not take a public inquiry to see the many mistakes the field has made over the previous decades. Yet, these mistakes most often are the result of tough decisions and the experimental pioneering of new technology – not a conscious vendetta against books as Baker accuses. In truth, preservation decisions such as microfilming are appraisal decisions. The appraisal process is quite imperfect and is perpetually debated by librarians and archivists. Decisions are far from above outside criticism. Yet, these decisions are made with an informed knowledge of a number of issues, and thus, carry more weight than that of an antagonistic writer with an insatiable love of books (and artificial bindings?) as artifacts. However there are very valid criticisms of the preservation appraisal decisions of the last several decades, namely librarians have almost completely ignored the access consequences in their appraisal decisions. Baker, however, is either too confused or too distracted to raise this criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the librarians’ actions, Baker brazenly outlines, is brittle paper. Ironically, the innovation of alum-rosin sizing that makes paper acidic and eventually brittle is what made the proliferation of newspapers possible in the first place. Twentieth-century librarians have often decided to reformat old brittle newspapers and books onto microforms with the goal of making them available permanently. In order to make the process more cost-effective, filming often required disbinding (to hasten the process) and destruction (to save storage costs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker protests that the disassembling and trashing of the books is not only unnecessary, but irreconcilable with libraries’ mission. He does not identify this as the preservation of the informational content and the loss of the physical content. In fact, he seems to think that these values are inseparable, stubbornly arguing that the old paper is not deteriorating, that microfilm does not effectively reproduce the text, and that microfilm does deteriorate. Baker finds that, “…wood-pulp newspapers of fifty and a hundred years ago are, contrary to incessant library propaganda, often surprisingly well preserved.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yet, despite Bakers discovery, brittle paper does deteriorate, albeit very slowly. Primarily, it is use of brittle paper that causes deterioration, not just time – and thus we can see the contrasting perspectives. Librarians most often manage the material that is used the most and we can see them saddened by the destruction of poor paper, reluctantly letting at-risk material be used, and continuously seeking any way to make the information more permanent. Baker, on the other hand, opens up bound volumes of newspapers to see the intact—and likely rarely used—pages. While it is true that the deterioration process can be a very slow one, Baker will not find the copies that have failed, for obvious reasons. Librarians want material to be available for a large volume of use, both careful and careless, for a very long time. This is a mission that brittle paper often cannot fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our polemist also points out that microforms are often not up to this task as well. First, he charges that they do serve as adequate surrogates for the original, failing to reproduce images and making the text difficult to make out. He charges that significant amounts of texts are lost in the process. He then details the various problems with different types of microform, like vinegar syndrome, before declaring even modern archival-quality microfilm insufficient. Some of the lesser microfilm, he complains, will not stand 175 degree temperatures, but he fails to mention the effect those conditions would have on brittle paper.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; While Baker points out that microforms—particularly older types—are not truly permanent either, they do hold up much better than poor paper with significant use in a good environment. Also, it is important to note that is easier to provide a good preservation environment for a run of newspapers on microfilm than on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker is also unnecessarily critical of film being used as a stopgap before digitization. He states that, “…attempts to scan the page-images of newspapers from old microfilm have not worked well—and will never work well—because microfilm itself is often at the squint-to-make-out level.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However modern filming with sufficient quality control produces images that can reproduce the text quite well. Microfilm readers, however, are more problematic. Contrary to Baker’s belief, microfilm to 1s and 0s is now quite commonplace, and cheaper than scanning from the originals. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Library has problems with extensive use of its collections. Repeated handling has done permanent damage to both good paper and acidic paper. Until recently, the preservation microfilm that has been performed over the years has gone unused as patrons preferred the originals. Now they are undergoing an extensive project to digitize multiple collections from microfilm. The images being produced are not preservation-quality digital images, yet the increased access with online availability have made these digital images preferable for researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the worst aspect of Baker’s book is his use of harsh hyperbolic language and unfair depictions of librarians. The perceptive reader will realize that powerful language does not replace evidence and historians will be disgusted with Baker’s appalling over-the-top demonization. Here we have “innocently trusted,” public servants on a campaign of, “methodical eradication,” “general devastation,” and, “annihilation,” that has, “…strip-mined a hundred and twenty years of its history.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Did Baker think readers would embrace the notion that our libraries are run by a conspiring cadre (who apparently think of themselves as movie studio moguls) who, “shamelessly lied,” and love, “petty vandalism”?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; While he avoids outwardly proclaiming a conspiracy he certainly preys upon its major themes, mongering that, “None of this epochal activity, in which the Library of Congress began its slow betrayal of an unknowing nation, was published in contemporary annual reports.” Yet, a page later he states that it did list the newspapers in itsInformation Bulletin and never tries to reconcile how conniving librarians so unabashedly reveal their aims elsewhere.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In is discussion of Cold War librarians he often juxtaposes random examples of craziness with library experiments as a key part of his argument. While Fremont Rider offers his (admittedly unscientific) estimates of library growth we are told that Rider also had written science fiction.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Baker states that he is unsure of whether William James Barrow actually believed his simulated aging estimates, then cites an interviewee who states that many of these numbers, “…were made to get people’s attention.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is a duplicitous way of arguing without evidence: perhaps Baker actually believed his argument; some would say he was writing to get people’s attention. To quote Baker: “This is of course utter horseshit and craziness.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our polemist always avoids nuanced and empathetical examinations of the figures in question, instead choosing to suggest purposeful maliciousness. The past is a foreign country, as they say, and it is exceedingly difficult to understand the culture and intellectual environment in which decisions were made. Baker fails to comprehend the positivism and faith in technology that pervaded the minds of librarians decades ago. While that does not excuse their poor judgments, it does mean that those decisions must be critiqued within that context. Isolating those choices, arguing without evidence, and assuming malicious intent is disingenuous and duplicitous. The librarians of the Cold War were driven by the immense fear that the books will be gone – the same fear as Nicholson Baker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some very valid criticisms preservation decisions of Cold War librarians, if only Baker recognized them. The most important failing has been the ignorance of access in preservation decisions. Despite the assertions of many forward-thinking librarians in the 1950s, microfilm is not nearly as effective a medium as paper books. While film effectively captures intellectual content, it acts as a tremendous barrier because it is more difficult to use. Many patrons such as Baker will be disappointed if the material they seek is only available on microfilm – some will seek another avenue rather than deal with the time-consuming, uncomfortable, and difficult-to-read microfilm reader. Microfilm cannot be checked out and read in the comfort of a researcher’s own home at his or her own schedule. Librarians (and archivists) have yet again focused on their holdings rather than their people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, dependence on microforms has not led to the apocalypse that Baker asserts. Microfilm has not, “…undermined American historiography far more seriously than anything that alum-tormented newsprint could possibly have done to itself.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On the contrary, these lost newspapers are still the most widely-used sources for American historians. Changes in historical theory have ended newspapers’ place as central pieces of evidence, yet one would be hard pressed to find a recent major work of American history that does not cite newspapers in some manner. They are comprehensive, widely accessible because of digitization, and good for context and cross-referencing. Contrary to what Baker thinks, academic historians have no time or value for reading newspapers, “…page by page month by month for pleasure…”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Every academic historian will be laugh at Baker’s assertion. They care little about “…gorgeously drippy art-nouveau graphics,” or “elaborately hand lettered ornamental headlines,” unless researching newspaper art history.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Whatever Baker thinks, that interest is so obscure that it hardly registers on archivists’ long list of appraisal priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, microfilm reproductions can me more accessible and more useful than the originals. Baker decries Barrow’s testing on the works of Bayard Taylor and William Cooper Prime, stating that, “Some of these books would be nice to have now…”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; While he would like us to think that these texts are lost, travel writings like these were so popular in the 1850s that one still stumbles upon them in old bookstores. Multiple copies are digitized and available with keyword search on Google Books or as ebooks from the Project Gutenberg. In one case a graduate student&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; researching the topic preferred a physical book. Luckily, facsimile reproductions from microfilm are cheaply purchased online and wholly readable on acid-free paper and good bindings. In one case, the graduate student purchased a copy of George William Curtis’s The Howaji in Syria for under $5 and unexpectedly received an 1865 original Harper &amp;amp; Brothers copy. The brittle paper and poor binding made this copy fairly unusable and definitively lesser than the reproductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker wants to keep every original published work, including each edition and alteration. Not only is he unable to grasp the sheer physics of a research library keeping every published work, he is seeking a comprehensive record of knowledge that simply does not exist. Preservation appraisal is not only about intrinsic value, but intellectual content, accessibility, feasibility, and a number of other concerns that Baker has not taken the time to understand despite interviewing scores of librarians and archivists. Intrinsic or artificial value seems simple, and objective to Baker, but it is nothing of the sort. Like any other aspect of culture, it is different for everyone, changes routinely, and often dramatically. Conservator Jane Smith might value the texture of 17th century paper, but the paper’s contemporaries certainly did not.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are very real and valid criticisms within Baker’s rant. Too bad he does not understand them.

The perceptive reader will realize that powerful language does not replace evidence and historians will be disgusted with Baker’s appalling over-the-top demonization. Here we have “innocently trusted,” public servants on a campaign of, “methodical eradication,” “general devastation,” and, “annihilation,” that has, “…strip-mined a hundred and twenty years of its history.”4 Did Baker think readers would embrace the notion that our libraries are run by a conspiring cadre (who apparently think of themselves as movie studio moguls) who, “shamelessly lied,” and love, “petty vandalism”?5 While he avoids outwardly proclaiming a conspiracy he certainly preys upon its major themes, mongering that, “None of this epochal activity, in which the Library of Congress began its slow betrayal of an unknowing nation, was published in contemporary annual reports.” Yet, a page later he states that it did list the newspapers in itsInformation Bulletin and never tries to reconcile how conniving librarians so unabashedly reveal their aims elsewhere.6 In is discussion of Cold War librarians he often juxtaposes random examples of craziness with library experiments as a key part of his argument. While Fremont Rider offers his (admittedly unscientific) estimates of library growth we are told that Rider also had written science fiction.7 Baker states that he is unsure of whether William James Barrow actually believed his simulated aging estimates, then cites an interviewee who states that many of these numbers, “…were made to get people’s attention.”8 This is a duplicitous way of arguing without evidence: perhaps Baker actually believed his argument; some would say he was writing to get people’s attention. To quote Baker: “This is of course utter horseshit and craziness.”9 Our polemist always avoids nuanced and empathetical examinations of the figures in question, instead choosing to suggest purposeful maliciousness. The past is a foreign country, as they say, and it is exceedingly difficult to understand the culture and intellectual environment in which decisions were made. Baker fails to comprehend the positivism and faith in technology that pervaded the minds of librarians decades ago. While that does not excuse their poor judgments, it does mean that those decisions must be critiqued within that context. Isolating those choices, arguing without evidence, and assuming malicious intent is disingenuous and duplicitous. The librarians of the Cold War were driven by the immense fear that the books will be gone – the same fear as Nicholson Baker. There are some very valid criticisms preservation decisions of Cold War librarians, if only Baker recognized them. The most important failing has been the ignorance of access in preservation decisions. Despite the assertions of many forward-thinking librarians in the 1950s, microfilm is not nearly as effective a medium as paper books. While film effectively captures intellectual content, it acts as a tremendous barrier because it is more difficult to use. Many patrons such as Baker will be disappointed if the material they seek is only available on microfilm – some will seek another avenue rather than deal with the time-consuming, uncomfortable, and difficult-to-read microfilm reader. Microfilm cannot be checked out and read in the comfort of a researcher’s own home at his or her own schedule. Librarians (and archivists) have yet again focused on their holdings rather than their people. Yet, dependence on microforms has not led to the apocalypse that Baker asserts. Microfilm has not, “…undermined American historiography far more seriously than anything that alum-tormented newsprint could possibly have done to itself.”10 On the contrary, these lost newspapers are still the most widely-used sources for American historians. Changes in historical theory have ended newspapers’ place as central pieces of evidence, yet one would be hard pressed to find a recent major work of American history that does not cite newspapers in some manner. They are comprehensive, widely accessible because of digitization, and good for context and cross-referencing. Contrary to what Baker thinks, academic historians have no time or value for reading newspapers, “…page by page month by month for pleasure…”11 Every academic historian will be laugh at Baker’s assertion. They care little about “…gorgeously drippy art-nouveau graphics,” or “elaborately hand lettered ornamental headlines,” unless researching newspaper art history.12 Whatever Baker thinks, that interest is so obscure that it hardly registers on archivists’ long list of appraisal priorities. In some cases, microfilm reproductions can me more accessible and more useful than the originals. Baker decries Barrow’s testing on the works of Bayard Taylor and William Cooper Prime, stating that, “Some of these books would be nice to have now…”13 While he would like us to think that these texts are lost, travel writings like these were so popular in the 1850s that one still stumbles upon them in old bookstores. Multiple copies are digitized and available with keyword search on Google Books or as ebooks from the Project Gutenberg. In one case a graduate student14 researching the topic preferred a physical book. Luckily, facsimile reproductions from microfilm are cheaply purchased online and wholly readable on acid-free paper and good bindings. In one case, the graduate student purchased a copy of George William Curtis’s The Howaji in Syria for under $5 and unexpectedly received an 1865 original Harper &amp;amp; Brothers copy. The brittle paper and poor binding made this copy fairly unusable and definitively lesser than the reproductions. Baker wants to keep every original published work, including each edition and alteration. Not only is he unable to grasp the sheer physics of a research library keeping every published work, he is seeking a comprehensive record of knowledge that simply does not exist. Preservation appraisal is not only about intrinsic value, but intellectual content, accessibility, feasibility, and a number of other concerns that Baker has not taken the time to understand despite interviewing scores of librarians and archivists. Intrinsic or artificial value seems simple, and objective to Baker, but it is nothing of the sort. Like any other aspect of culture, it is different for everyone, changes routinely, and often dramatically. Conservator Jane Smith might value the texture of 17th century paper, but the paper’s contemporaries certainly did not.15 There are very real and valid criticisms within Baker’s rant. Too bad he does not understand them.

The narrative is one example when archivists gave up their traditional and inward-looking ways of doing things and embraced new technology that enabled them to better promote the use of their most valued and protected material. In other words, EAD is promoted as a successful process when archivists relinquished their curmudgeonly ways of union catalogs and in-person research visits and embraced a standard that allowed their access tools to be accessible from anywhere in the world with only an internet connection. Today, EAD is ubiquitous in the archival field, particularly in university archives, and is seen as a successful and maturing standard - one that was well worth the years of development and the efforts of archivists across the country to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, recent research has cast many of these assumptions into doubt. While archivists have been patting themselves on the back for their successful embracement of the online world, the field has been inexcusably blind to its new online users. Until quite recently there has been a disparaging gap in published user studies on EAD finding aids on the Internet. As Xiaomu Zhou exclaims, “Missing from most of the literature are analyses addressing the researchers’ use of web sites, interface design of archival web sites, selection of search engines, implementation of search systems, and other related functions of for structured finding aids.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, recent research finds many users befuddled when they come across a repository’s webpage. It seems that archivists all over the country are confident enough in their success that they expect users to magically know that their online finding aids often do not lead users to their content! This is in direct contradiction to just about every other information delivery system users will find on the web. If Wikipedia provides full-text online content users will expect online finding aids to. Very rarely will a user be easily notified of this difference in an online EAD finding aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears, after all, that the narrative of the traditional archivist accepting modernity is somewhat of a red herring. As many of this new research shows, archivists have not relinquished their traditional processes, but have used EAD as a path to continue these obsolete practices in a web environment. Is there any reason an online finding aid should look like its 1950s counterpart? EAD, as it is currently used, has not led to the creation of innovative internet information systems that adhere to archival principles. This, after all, is the primary goal. Are archivists really comfortable that small internet startups that come and go all have more effective information systems than a profession that has over a century of history developing access tools? There must be a major wake-up call for the field and the success and utility of EAD must be called into doubt. We must wonder if different methods can be used to improve online access to archival materials. EAD, it seems, must adapt or become obsolete. To accomplish its abstract mission of enabling effecting online information systems for archival material it may have to significantly shrink its technical scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper takes long strides to gather recent research on EAD and user studies of online finding aids. First, we will briefly discuss the importance of online access to the archival profession and the great potential of online finding aids. Next we will step in to the ring with the prevailing literature. Thomas J. Frusciano, editor of the Journal of Archival Organization introduces our topic by confidently looking towards the second wave of EAD usage by archivists who he argues are lucky to have avoided the pains of the pioneers. Next, some minor issues arrive with Jinhun Kim’s content analysis of EAD online finding aids. Concerns are then heightened when Xiaomu Zhou examines EAD search functions and their deficiencies. Next, we shall discuss the work of Anne J. Gilliland-Swetland-perhaps the first critic of EAD online information systems. She painstakingly outlines the reasons for the form of traditional finding aids. Therefore her suggestions for improving browsing and retrieval in EAD finding aids cannot be seen as heresy. However, it seems that her suggestions may be insufficient in the context of Joyce Celeste Chapman’s user study at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Her study explicitly shows that both advanced and novice archival users find online EAD finding aids to be gravely deficient. Finally, J. Gordon Daines III &amp;amp; Cory L. Nimer propose radical changes to the ways online finding aids are displayed. The Brigham Young University finding aid system is a new alternative model to delivering archival access tool online. Despite its imperfections, its presence is sure to be a positive influence on the field. Finally, we will offer some simple and resource-cheap strategies for a modified presentation of a typical EAD finding aid. These strategies will reveal some glaring holes in EAD and provoke a radical new suggestion for its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The era of the internet and ubiquitous computing has brought drastic changes to perhaps all professions. For archives it represents a vast and underutilized potential to grow. The field has an image problem. The public associates valuable material with museums who occupy a much larger role in everyday life. Thus, many people have assumed that access to archival materials follows the same behind-the-rope and no-touching principles of museums. This has not been helped by some archivists who over decades have unfortunately valued the material over the access of the public. Museums are located in central public places and promoted to all while archives are generally regulated to an obscure portion of a library. Visitors to the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt are shepherded away from historic artifacts by the Park Service but many would be shocked to realize that they could walk across the lawn to another building and handle the original documents from the president’s secret office safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet allows archives to reestablish its reputation in the eyes of the public. In today’s online environment content-any content-has value, and major players such as Google and social networking companies do whatever they can to draw eyeballs. Archives are full of unique content with enduring public value, and the internet allows archivists to provide access in a way that poses almost no risk to the material. Everywhere on the web interesting content is shared and commented on-passed on by users, for users-and material that has traditionally only been accessible for conscious research can now be available for perfunctory use by almost everyone. Now, schoolteachers, janitors, armchair activists, accountants, and any number of people may be interested in casual use of archival material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may instinctually feel like it is outside the traditional mission of archives, it is not. Our purpose is to retain and provide access to material of enduring value. Limiting, avoiding, or even looking down upon some use of material runs counter to the purpose of archives and of records themselves. More usage broadens the presence of archives everyday life which is likely to educate all stakeholders of the practices and needs of archivists. Major projects may become easier to justify to funders and users may approach repositories with better perspectives on their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the Internet offers archives with the vast potential to rehabilitate its image in the public eye. Our material must be as accessible as our principles state and our information systems must present the expertise archivists assume they have. By working toward an idealistic presentation of our core principles in an online environment, we educate the public about what we do. Thus, the online arm of a repository holds incredible potential for that institution to raise its stature in the public’s perception. Any negligence in providing feasible online information services must be sharply criticized and corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EAD emerged from a long development period in the 1990s to rapid implementation during the 2000s. Advocates heralded it as the next generation of finding aid, the archival access tool for the internet. While not all archives have found it feasible to switch to EAD, its many users have given it significant momentum as an archival standard. Archivists’ most favorite topic for the late 1990s and early 2000s appears to have been the implementation of EAD and its feasibility. Archivists throughout the country made use of the new standard while being relatively blind to the perceptions of their users. For some years, user studies of online finding aids were few and far between as archivists leaped before they looked - spending significant resources on the switch to EAD before acknowledging the concerns of the people it was supposed to be delivering information to. Only recently has new research revealed significant insufficiencies in typical EAD online finding aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas J. Frusciano is as confident as most archivists in the growth and proliferation of EAD. He described the early implementers of the late 1990s as pioneers who bravely stuck their neck out and pushed forward with a process that was still in flux and not yet finalized. He describes how, “Since the publication of these initial studies the archival profession has witnessed an explosion of developments that have enhanced our ability to understand, implement, and adapt EAD in our own descriptive practice.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now, however, archivists are sure to have an easier time as the development of an EAD community has led to the spread of toolkits and templates to aid archivists of many technical backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frusciano tells a narrative of deliberate, yet rapid improvement as the profession as a whole gave a large effort to ensure progress. He details the labors of the Society of American Archivists’ EAD Working Group which led to the release of EAD Tag Library 1.0, and them, EAD Application Guidelines - two publications that shepherded early adopters. Issues that arose in launch EAD programs led to a constructive response from the archival community. The input evolved into EAD 2002, “…with significant changes that addressed these concerns.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To ease the burden of those pioneers in switching over, the Working Group developed a script to automate the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profession has also worked diligently to instruct its constituency on how to use EAD. As Frusciano states, “Over the past ten years, education has been a major focus with EAD.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He continues to detail the successes of national workshops, stylesheet workshops, local workshops and the adoption of the standard into the curriculum of most graduate programs. Now, not only are current archivists expected to be comfortable with EAD, but new hires will be well versed in its use. Frusciano also credits Michael J. Fox’s EAD Cookbook with providing the necessary practical assistance and tools that has enabled older professionals to easily adopt the standard. The utility of the Cookbook has led to its wide use, and thus it has also served as a stabilizing presence by making the use of EAD more consistent. In addition, Frusciano discusses the development of new, open-source collection management tools such as Archivist’s Toolkit and ARCHON which have been growing in popularity. Their assumption of EAD as the natural endpoint of collections has proven to be a boon to the standard. In turn, the easing the transition to EAD is also a reason for the popularity of these programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Frusciano is confident that the profession has admirably combated the significant barriers that surround the dissemination of a national standard - particularly one that requires some new technical skills like EAD. He assuredly proclaims that “…we are in the midst of the next wave of EAD implementation…,” and that, “The challenges and obstacles faced by the early implementers of EAD related to the technical tasks of encoding and the display of finding aids. But the experience and results of these initial efforts has essentially eliminated many of these problems.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He is describing the maturation of a new standard - the point where its adoption is no longer arduous, but almost reflexive. However, while Frusciano is rightly celebrating the newfound capability of archivists to use XML in archival representation, this assumes EAD will-and should-be cemented as a permanent process. In fact, this development should draw great concern. EAD is now a benchmark for repositories to be satisfied with their online presence: it seems that any EAD display is acceptable and even impressive within the field. Full implementation is highly valued with little concern for utility. Thus, momentum towards maturity may be more of an argument for reexamination rather than blind advancement. We have the example of the MARC standard to warn us to the incredible permanence of a mature standard. Its use has become widespread, yet this prevalence proves it to be incredibly resistant to improvement or change. Such success with EAD may come with similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through much of its early history, the profession pushed forward with EAD without significant focus on its utility to users. Jihyun Kim offered a relatively early critique of online finding aids, by focusing on the presented content from a user’s point of view. The author took a sample of one random finding aid from the 17 of the 161 institutions of the Research Library group who used EAD. A content analysis was performed that examined variation among the finding aids in five major categories: data elements, labeling terminology, navigational aids, browsing arrangement, and search features. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The author’s hypothesis suggests that inconsistencies are detrimental to the utility of EAD finding aids. As she argues, “…variances in local practice result in rendering the EAD finding aids online in diverse ways causing problems for both end users and archivists wanting to create databases of finding aids across repositories.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She highlights these irregularities and offers some small suggestions for fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author separated her five points of examination into three aspects. First, she looked at the use of data elements in online EAD finding aids and their popularity. The most popular tags were physical description (&lt;physdesc&gt;), title proper (&lt;titleproper&gt;), unit title (&lt;unittitle&gt;), and biography or history (&lt;bioghist&gt;), each used 15 or 16 out of a possible 17 times. Jihyun is disturbed that the wide use of both the title proper and unit title tags may lead to redundancy and confusion. The duplication of date (&lt;date&gt;) and unit date (&lt;unitdate&gt;) drew the same concern. Administrative tags, like access restrictions (&lt;accessrestrict&gt;), acquisition information (&lt;acqinfo&gt;), and preferred citation (&lt;predercite&gt;) enjoyed mixed use and the author laments that the controlled access headings tag (&lt;controlaccess&gt;) was rarely user. Overall, the findings proved to confirm the supposition that there is significant variation among the use of EAD elements. Jihyun argues that some tags are underutilized - particularly the controlled access headings. This limits the number of access points - what she believes is the greatest utility of EAD. While more access points-as we will discuss-may help users, her faith in subject headings in particular may be misplaced as we will see below.&lt;/controlaccess&gt;&lt;/predercite&gt;&lt;/acqinfo&gt;&lt;/accessrestrict&gt;&lt;/unitdate&gt;&lt;/date&gt;&lt;/bioghist&gt;&lt;/unittitle&gt;&lt;/titleproper&gt;&lt;/physdesc&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, Jihyun looked at interface design, particularly labeling terminology and navigational aids. She found that the language used to label EAD fields for the user to be inconsistent, suggesting that, “Users might be confused if the naming of labeling terminology is not consistent with the content.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She then argues that, since EAD is only a data structure standard, a related data content standard is needed. This problem has since been fixed by the development of Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS), which offers consistent vocabulary for finding aids and is readily transferred to EAD. However, as we shall see, the use of DACS in EAD may have worsened usability issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For navigation, Jihyun discussed the use of four features: expand/collapse functions, back-and-forth indicators, back-to-top links, and frames. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The most common feature was the use of frames - namely to construct navigational link toolbars. This allows both content and context to be displayed in a single window. Expand and Collapse functions were also used in over half of finding aids. This feature allows users to view both higher and lower levels of more complex hierarchies while avoiding irrelevant information from other lower levels. Back-and-forth and back-to-top links were seen less, used in five and two examples respectively. Five EAD finding aids offered no navigational features whatsoever, leading to the display of long narratives and seemingly endless container lists. Jihyun criticizes the lack of navigational utilities, positing that long finding aids by themselves make it difficult to find content and easy to get lost among the countless pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the author studied the accessibility of these 17 EAD finding aids from their repositories’ web pages. 16 of the 17 sites offered some sort of inventory of finding aids to browse. These were commonly alphabetical, with ten sites sorting by collection title and five by creator name. One site seems to have offered a variety of ways to sort, such as by repository, date, or collection number. Jihyun bemoans the failure of many of these sites to be explicit in their sorting methods. She then argues that while browsing can be useful, it is a usually time-consuming task-particularly in repositories with a long list of collections-and that searching can be more helpful. Jihyun deems searching, “a growing necessity,” finding that seven out of the 17 sites offer this feature. She discusses the use of delimiters, results displays, and Boolean operators before concluding in general, that, “Even though searching would be an effective way of accessing EAD finding aids, less than half of the sampled web sides provided search functions.” Overall, she discovered that archivists can improve their EAD finding aids by offering more diverse access points, consistent terminology, more navigational aids, explicit browsing features, and search functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploitation of search is the topic of Xiaomu Zhou’s study which again finds the status quo in EAD finding aids to be drastically insufficient. While Xiaomu admits that the EAD structure has had a large impact in the field, she contends that it has not led to the development of useful search functions to improve access. She argues that, “EAD finding aids are in, and of themselves, only one element in enhanced online search systems,” and, “To fully realize the benefit of EAD finding aids, there must be a good underlying search strategy.” In other words, archivists have been satisfied with the mere encoding and presentation of finding aids with EAD - they need to realize that EAD does not promote accessible web pages from a navigational perspective. There must be additional access tools, particularly search functions that enable users to comfortably retrieve content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiaomu examines the delivery functions of EAD information systems - particularly search. A content analysis was performed on 58 EAD finding aid delivery systems that were listed by the Library of Congress in December of 2003. The author looked at the types of search engines used, the availability of search options, and the display of search results and criticism was made based on popular Web design theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, only 45 out of a possible 58 archival web sites offered search functions. A variety of types was represented, such as commercial search engines, freeware search engines, and database-based search. The author discussed each of these offerings in turn with the most features coming from the freeware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiaomu argues that search options are the method that most fully exploits EAD’s structure. EAD divides its content by a number of elements, which should allow search engines to filter queries based on certain elements. Unfortunately, only about half of the 45 search functions offered multiple options for searching, and even these were inconsistent in practice. Thus, she concludes that the possible search benefits of EAD are wholly underutilized. Search functions of EAD finding aids receive similar marks on their display of results. The author found that, “Nearly half of the websites with search systems did not organize their retrieval results very well.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She argues that archivists must take the design of results display seriously, “…because display really influences the efficiency of the entire system.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The author continued to criticize the lack of advance search features, like feedback for zero results or mobility between search and browsing. Still, these relatively minor features were only represented in about half of search systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that search functions of EAD finding aids are not up to snuff. Xiaomu concludes that, “…the functionality of search systems on web sites varied considerable, and the advantages of EAD finding aids for hierarchical searching have not been fully realized. She continues to charge that archivists have focused more on the implementation of EAD than on the delivery of encoded information, as laments that many have outsourced this more important process. While there are certainly feasibility issues here, that does not excuse archivists for being oblivious to the actual delivery of their online content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne J. Gilliland-Swetland is perhaps the first critic to the way EAD is being used to present online finding aids. She sees EAD as having the enormous potential to help archivists reexamine archival information systems. In order to deflect opposition to her suggestions she first discusses why finding aids were developed in the traditional format and then shows how EAD aids these purposes. Then, she details some basic requirements of online information systems. Finally, in light of these two discussions she offers ten suggestions to redesign online finding aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Gilliland-Swetland, archival finding aids developed into their current state to serve three primary purposes. First, finding aids served to document provenance and original order and to authenticate the existence of material. This helps makes collections permanent entities and documents changes such as accruals. These concerns led to the finding aid’s hierarchical structure. She details how, “Finding aids proceed from the general-an overview description of a collection-to the specific-a description at the lowest level of analysis, most commonly the file level but potentially the individual document (i.e., item-level)-all while reflecting the native arraignment of the archival materials.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; EAD can accomplish this and more. She discusses how structure is required, as non-compliant pages will fail to display, and how templates can be used to ensure completeness and consistency. She then lists a number of EAD elements that help authenticate and document by specifying things like accruals (&lt;accruals&gt;) or custodial history (&lt;custodhist&gt;). The archival reference (&lt;archref&gt;) element in particular allows for even more documentation of contextual linkages than is possible with a paper finding aid. The traditional finding aid was locked into its traditional physical form to ensure authenticity and documentation, but one elements are encoded they can be displayed in different ways whilst still retaining contextual relationships.&lt;/archref&gt;&lt;/custodhist&gt;&lt;/accruals&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional finding aid was also developed to be a collections management tool as archivists have long used them to store internal information. In EAD, there are elements for administrative information (&lt;admininfo&gt;), restrictions (&lt;accessrestrict&gt; or &lt;userestrict&gt;), acquisitions information (&lt;acqinfo&gt;), and processing information (&lt;processinfo&gt;). These can also be directed to apply to only select material within a collection. In fact, in the traditional format, irrelevant collection management information could confuse users. Now, sensitive or extraneous information may be hidden from user eyes whilst still being available to the archivist.&lt;/processinfo&gt;&lt;/acqinfo&gt;&lt;/userestrict&gt;&lt;/accessrestrict&gt;&lt;/admininfo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final function performed by the traditional finding aid was its use as in information discovery and retrieval tool. It has been used for both browsing and known-item searching by both archivists and users. However, Gilliland-Swetland charges that, “Consideration of user needs in terms of effectively carrying out thee activities has not traditionally been factored into the design of the finding aids.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She continues to accuse archivists of long describing to their own needs rather than the needs of their users. Thus, finding aids have been long organized primarily by provenance and original order rather than subject. This extensive contextual information is often not valued by users, and when it is-as in the case of academic historians-these users often come prepared. While they still need reassurance of this information, this goal is secondary to finding the content they need. The most common approach is known-item searches, which archivists have not valued. In fact, the author charges that “…the traditional finding aid makes direct, de-contextualized access to archival materials close to impossible.” Description at the lower levels is often the lowest priority even though this level is most important for known-item searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, legitimate reasons for finding aids’ insufficiency in information discovery. One is the cost of description at lower levels. Another reason is that archivists have needed create universal access tools that were used to describe a wide range of archival material. Hierarchies have been used in order to simply and easily organize this variable and organic material whilst preserving the original order. Gilliland-Swetland sees the online finding aid as having the immense potential to create an effective information delivery system that is still feasible despite these uniquely archival challenges. She argues that, “The materials-centric and the user-centric approaches can now be simultaneously addressed, if not reconciled, through thoughtful design of EAD-based archival information systems.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piece continues to profile the needs of potential archival user groups in order to make these behaviors readily possible in online finding aids. Academic historians need contextual information, but that requirement is often secondary to discovery. While they require the maintenance of original order, more access points would be helpful. Institutional administrators need to search by subject or perform known-item searches to reference specific materials for content or recall documents for legal use. K-12 teachers now need to use primary source material in the classroom. They need easy access to visual materials at the lower level and the ability to then discern contextual information. Genealogists require administrative histories in order to locate where certain records may be housed. They also need to be able to search and retrieve at the lower level and would be helped by name and date access points. Other features they enjoy are genealogical guides of know people and collaborative web spaces to share their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this discussion Gilliland-Swetland makes ten suggestions for improving online archival information systems. He takes an idealistic approach with little concern for feasibility. This leads to proposals like linking between archival content and full-text secondary material. While her suggestions may be unmanageable, her approach is most valuable. This methodology is the inverse of the development of EAD the thinking of most archivists. The profession has long created inadequate access tools that required mediation by the archivists. In an online environment that intervention is quite difficult. However, that same online environment offers immense potential for archivists to redesign their problematic access tools. Gilliland-Swetland argues that, “In order to exploit the potential of EAD most fully… archivists must look beyond the current intellectual and physical form of the finding aid to a fundamental re-conceptualization of the role of archival metadata with in more inclusive archival information system.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Despite her confidence in it, it is clear that EAD has not led to this change, but has served to continue archival access intransigence into the Internet age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the profession has long lacked effective user studies of its online EAD finding aids, the resent research of Joyce Celeste Chapman has yielded quite harsh criticism of their utility. She argues that archivists need direct and systematic interaction with users in order to understand their needs. Chapman’s reasoning for this is poignant. She argues that, “As archivists work to refine finding aid web displays, it is important to remember that the goals of descriptive standards should not and do not include display. User needs and the principles of web design, rather than the structure of the EAD XML standard, should dictate how finding aids are displayed.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand users’ interaction with online EAD finding aids, Chapman performed a usability study for the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. The interaction of twelve participants with online finding aids was examined. This group consisted of six experienced archives users and six novice users. The study asked how users interest and use online displays, how fast are new users able to learn, and what necessary features are missing from online archival information systems?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study showed that, understandably, experience in both internet usage and archives helped users successfully navigate finding aids. In fact, internet proficiency was the most important aid to users. The system did little to support known-item searches and users were forced to rely on the bowser search function (ctrl+F) which explained the utility of internet proficiency. Series titles were extensively relied upon and when these titles reflected the format of material rather than “aboutness” users were confounded. Reactions to the experimental navigation features were mixed, but the author offered the hope the some more user-friendly tools may help alleviate the difficulty users have with hierarchies. Neither the novice nor the experienced users saw subject headings as helpful in any sense. Archival terminology without context was confusing to users. In fact, as Chapman states, “Complaints about terminology were one of the largest issues that arose during the study.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This calls the role of DACS in online archival information systems into doubt. Despite Jihyun Kim’s calls for a content standard, it seems that this terminology may be detrimental to the usability of online finding aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, Chapman found that the lack of an in-page search option was extremely problematic to all users. For known-item searches, users prefer immediate search and avoided the large blocks of contextual information that are most prominent in almost all finding aids. In fact, Chapman even found that, “…when a search function is not available, rather than attempt to navigate in any other way some users would rather move up a level in the site’s hierarchy to where there is a search, even though this takes them further from their known goal.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For known-item searching, which makes of a large amount of information needs, search is a life raft to users, and if a finding aid does not supply one they will consider this unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman’s study is a great start at challenging current online archival information systems with user experiences. From even these relatively small insights into user behavior it is already clear that our archival finding aids are not effective in meeting user wants and needs. The author is correct in asserting that only though the experiences of users can archivists learn the knowledge they need to develop more effective systems that take advantage of the Internet for the profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this spirit, J. Gordon Daines III and Cory L. Nimer offer a radical new take on the structure of online archival finding aids. They despair that EAD finding aids, in their current popular form, have, “…created an access barrier to the materials they describe.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Instead, the authors suggest a reevaluation of online archival information systems based on user studies their expectations of search tools. They argue that, “In order to encourage use of our materials, archivists need to employ principles of user-centered design to ensure that our interfaces are transparent and meet our users’ needs.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yet, the authors lament how little progress has been made in interface design since the development of EAD. Online archival finding aids must look and act like most other information systems on the web. New findings from user studies have revealed serious insufficiencies in finding aid interfaces. In order to meet these standards, Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer argue that single-level display-or a discrete web page for each archival level-is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors disparage archivists’ unrelinquishing love of document-based displays. This intransigence is furthered by the popularity of Archivist’s Toolkit and ARCHON - both of which, “…have been developed with a document-based view of EAD files.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The authors continue to discuss two more obscure collection management tools, PLEADE and ICA-AtoM-the only ones that help to build single-level displays-in an attempt to popularize this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer have used these critiques of typical online finding aids to offer a radical new take on an archival information system at BYU. All of their pages follow popular Web design principles in that they avoid using large blocks of text and long, scroll-heavy lists. Instead, the necessary contextual information is offered, not at the beginning of the finding aid, but directly next to the content to which it pertains. Their main page emphasizes keyword search, and the advanced search is able to search at the collection, series, sub-series, or file level - or users can select to search only digitized materials that are available online. The information from what was the scope and content note is now spread out and available at the pages of lower levels. The authors succinctly argue that short descriptors at the collection level are actually in accordance with DACS. Some information from the collection level-such as restrictions or repository information-“cascades” down and is again available at lower levels. Archival context is preserves in a scrollable hierarchy window on the right hand side of series-level pages, yet is not the primary navigational focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that, while this new model is far from perfect, they believe is the step in the right direction. Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer argue that we need to spend less time attempting to educate users on how to use our obscure tools and more time designing self-explanatory online finding aids that follow the same design principles as the rest of the web. Only the creation of easily accessible online archival information systems can we fully exploit the vast potential of the internet to grow the use of archives. Perhaps the best argument Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer make is that encoding gives us the ability to innovate - to relinquish our traditional ways and actually develop useful ways of delivering archival material over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can make a few simple and resource-cheap suggestions for online finding aids based on these very significant critiques of current practices. The first is to explain to users that the purpose of an online finding aid is not necessarily to deliver online content. This makes finding aids quite unique in an online environment and users should not be expected to know as much. Perhaps a red or green button could state it that finding aid contains online material or not. The button could link to either a page that details specifically how to find the digitized material or a page that deliberately explains the expense and technical difficulties in providing online content to all materials. The second suggestion is to adopt Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer’s idea of distinct pages for every level of hierarchy above the file level. This, coupled with a left-hand navigation bar will help users to navigate complex hierarchies in a more comfortable fashion. The third suggestion is to spread out the contextual information to the lower levels where it directly applies. The primary scope and content note would be a simple statement that gives a rough description of what the materials are. A link to “more information” brings users to a discrete page which contains that entire scope notes for every level of the collection. This more detailed information will also be offered at the series and subseries levels. Where large amounts of information are needed, bullet points will replace long paragraphs. The forth suggestion is that the containers lists at the series or sub series level, will be collapsible, and in their collapsed form will give not only the container number, but a concise descriptor. This will be particularly useful for alphabetical series. Thus the collapsed containers would read, “Box 34 - Def-Gai,” “Box 35 Gal-Jer,” etc. This will allow for navigation in the collapsed display. The forth suggestion is that archival terminology be given context when there is none. While this may contradict DACS, it is necessary to ensure users understand section titles. Thus, “Provenance” might read “Provenance (origins of material).” While this may be uncomfortable to some archivists, the result would be to better educate users to concepts like provenance. These few minor suggestions should be fairly easy to implement and will make significant strides towards increasing the accessibility of online finding aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the problem we face is that EAD is only compatible with some of these changes. The solution may be to limit the technical role of EAD to coincide with its intended use. EAD is a data format standard, nothing more. Why is it commonly used for display? Perhaps the primary problem of using EAD to display content is that the interface will always look outdated. Today, many EAD finding aids look as if they are from the late 1990s. This is because general web design makes interface and design advances much faster that the profession can design new XML style sheets. We should treat EAD like a data format standard–like a set of machine-readable fields–and let general HTML manage the interface and display. The HTML interface can be a template that can link to a set EAD file for content. This will allow archivists to continually develop more sophisticated and user-friendly information systems while keeping pace with the general web community. As Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer argue, EAD enables us to innovate, and using EAD to structure online display prevents us from doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Gregory Wiedeman</name></author><summary type="html">Encoded Archival Description (EAD) is often cited as a remarkable success story in the world of archival standards. The narrative is one example when archivists gave up their traditional and inward-looking ways of doing things and embraced new technology that enabled them to better promote the use of their most valued and protected material. In other words, EAD is promoted as a successful process when archivists relinquished their curmudgeonly ways of union catalogs and in-person research visits and embraced a standard that allowed their access tools to be accessible from anywhere in the world with only an internet connection. Today, EAD is ubiquitous in the archival field, particularly in university archives, and is seen as a successful and maturing standard - one that was well worth the years of development and the efforts of archivists across the country to implement. However, recent research has cast many of these assumptions into doubt. While archivists have been patting themselves on the back for their successful embracement of the online world, the field has been inexcusably blind to its new online users. Until quite recently there has been a disparaging gap in published user studies on EAD finding aids on the Internet. As Xiaomu Zhou exclaims, “Missing from most of the literature are analyses addressing the researchers’ use of web sites, interface design of archival web sites, selection of search engines, implementation of search systems, and other related functions of for structured finding aids.”1 In fact, recent research finds many users befuddled when they come across a repository’s webpage. It seems that archivists all over the country are confident enough in their success that they expect users to magically know that their online finding aids often do not lead users to their content! This is in direct contradiction to just about every other information delivery system users will find on the web. If Wikipedia provides full-text online content users will expect online finding aids to. Very rarely will a user be easily notified of this difference in an online EAD finding aid. It appears, after all, that the narrative of the traditional archivist accepting modernity is somewhat of a red herring. As many of this new research shows, archivists have not relinquished their traditional processes, but have used EAD as a path to continue these obsolete practices in a web environment. Is there any reason an online finding aid should look like its 1950s counterpart? EAD, as it is currently used, has not led to the creation of innovative internet information systems that adhere to archival principles. This, after all, is the primary goal. Are archivists really comfortable that small internet startups that come and go all have more effective information systems than a profession that has over a century of history developing access tools? There must be a major wake-up call for the field and the success and utility of EAD must be called into doubt. We must wonder if different methods can be used to improve online access to archival materials. EAD, it seems, must adapt or become obsolete. To accomplish its abstract mission of enabling effecting online information systems for archival material it may have to significantly shrink its technical scope. This paper takes long strides to gather recent research on EAD and user studies of online finding aids. First, we will briefly discuss the importance of online access to the archival profession and the great potential of online finding aids. Next we will step in to the ring with the prevailing literature. Thomas J. Frusciano, editor of the Journal of Archival Organization introduces our topic by confidently looking towards the second wave of EAD usage by archivists who he argues are lucky to have avoided the pains of the pioneers. Next, some minor issues arrive with Jinhun Kim’s content analysis of EAD online finding aids. Concerns are then heightened when Xiaomu Zhou examines EAD search functions and their deficiencies. Next, we shall discuss the work of Anne J. Gilliland-Swetland-perhaps the first critic of EAD online information systems. She painstakingly outlines the reasons for the form of traditional finding aids. Therefore her suggestions for improving browsing and retrieval in EAD finding aids cannot be seen as heresy. However, it seems that her suggestions may be insufficient in the context of Joyce Celeste Chapman’s user study at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Her study explicitly shows that both advanced and novice archival users find online EAD finding aids to be gravely deficient. Finally, J. Gordon Daines III &amp;amp; Cory L. Nimer propose radical changes to the ways online finding aids are displayed. The Brigham Young University finding aid system is a new alternative model to delivering archival access tool online. Despite its imperfections, its presence is sure to be a positive influence on the field. Finally, we will offer some simple and resource-cheap strategies for a modified presentation of a typical EAD finding aid. These strategies will reveal some glaring holes in EAD and provoke a radical new suggestion for its future. The era of the internet and ubiquitous computing has brought drastic changes to perhaps all professions. For archives it represents a vast and underutilized potential to grow. The field has an image problem. The public associates valuable material with museums who occupy a much larger role in everyday life. Thus, many people have assumed that access to archival materials follows the same behind-the-rope and no-touching principles of museums. This has not been helped by some archivists who over decades have unfortunately valued the material over the access of the public. Museums are located in central public places and promoted to all while archives are generally regulated to an obscure portion of a library. Visitors to the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt are shepherded away from historic artifacts by the Park Service but many would be shocked to realize that they could walk across the lawn to another building and handle the original documents from the president’s secret office safe. The internet allows archives to reestablish its reputation in the eyes of the public. In today’s online environment content-any content-has value, and major players such as Google and social networking companies do whatever they can to draw eyeballs. Archives are full of unique content with enduring public value, and the internet allows archivists to provide access in a way that poses almost no risk to the material. Everywhere on the web interesting content is shared and commented on-passed on by users, for users-and material that has traditionally only been accessible for conscious research can now be available for perfunctory use by almost everyone. Now, schoolteachers, janitors, armchair activists, accountants, and any number of people may be interested in casual use of archival material. While this may instinctually feel like it is outside the traditional mission of archives, it is not. Our purpose is to retain and provide access to material of enduring value. Limiting, avoiding, or even looking down upon some use of material runs counter to the purpose of archives and of records themselves. More usage broadens the presence of archives everyday life which is likely to educate all stakeholders of the practices and needs of archivists. Major projects may become easier to justify to funders and users may approach repositories with better perspectives on their services. Altogether, the Internet offers archives with the vast potential to rehabilitate its image in the public eye. Our material must be as accessible as our principles state and our information systems must present the expertise archivists assume they have. By working toward an idealistic presentation of our core principles in an online environment, we educate the public about what we do. Thus, the online arm of a repository holds incredible potential for that institution to raise its stature in the public’s perception. Any negligence in providing feasible online information services must be sharply criticized and corrected. EAD emerged from a long development period in the 1990s to rapid implementation during the 2000s. Advocates heralded it as the next generation of finding aid, the archival access tool for the internet. While not all archives have found it feasible to switch to EAD, its many users have given it significant momentum as an archival standard. Archivists’ most favorite topic for the late 1990s and early 2000s appears to have been the implementation of EAD and its feasibility. Archivists throughout the country made use of the new standard while being relatively blind to the perceptions of their users. For some years, user studies of online finding aids were few and far between as archivists leaped before they looked - spending significant resources on the switch to EAD before acknowledging the concerns of the people it was supposed to be delivering information to. Only recently has new research revealed significant insufficiencies in typical EAD online finding aids. Thomas J. Frusciano is as confident as most archivists in the growth and proliferation of EAD. He described the early implementers of the late 1990s as pioneers who bravely stuck their neck out and pushed forward with a process that was still in flux and not yet finalized. He describes how, “Since the publication of these initial studies the archival profession has witnessed an explosion of developments that have enhanced our ability to understand, implement, and adapt EAD in our own descriptive practice.”2 Now, however, archivists are sure to have an easier time as the development of an EAD community has led to the spread of toolkits and templates to aid archivists of many technical backgrounds. Frusciano tells a narrative of deliberate, yet rapid improvement as the profession as a whole gave a large effort to ensure progress. He details the labors of the Society of American Archivists’ EAD Working Group which led to the release of EAD Tag Library 1.0, and them, EAD Application Guidelines - two publications that shepherded early adopters. Issues that arose in launch EAD programs led to a constructive response from the archival community. The input evolved into EAD 2002, “…with significant changes that addressed these concerns.” 3 To ease the burden of those pioneers in switching over, the Working Group developed a script to automate the process. The profession has also worked diligently to instruct its constituency on how to use EAD. As Frusciano states, “Over the past ten years, education has been a major focus with EAD.”4 He continues to detail the successes of national workshops, stylesheet workshops, local workshops and the adoption of the standard into the curriculum of most graduate programs. Now, not only are current archivists expected to be comfortable with EAD, but new hires will be well versed in its use. Frusciano also credits Michael J. Fox’s EAD Cookbook with providing the necessary practical assistance and tools that has enabled older professionals to easily adopt the standard. The utility of the Cookbook has led to its wide use, and thus it has also served as a stabilizing presence by making the use of EAD more consistent. In addition, Frusciano discusses the development of new, open-source collection management tools such as Archivist’s Toolkit and ARCHON which have been growing in popularity. Their assumption of EAD as the natural endpoint of collections has proven to be a boon to the standard. In turn, the easing the transition to EAD is also a reason for the popularity of these programs. Overall, Frusciano is confident that the profession has admirably combated the significant barriers that surround the dissemination of a national standard - particularly one that requires some new technical skills like EAD. He assuredly proclaims that “…we are in the midst of the next wave of EAD implementation…,” and that, “The challenges and obstacles faced by the early implementers of EAD related to the technical tasks of encoding and the display of finding aids. But the experience and results of these initial efforts has essentially eliminated many of these problems.” 5 He is describing the maturation of a new standard - the point where its adoption is no longer arduous, but almost reflexive. However, while Frusciano is rightly celebrating the newfound capability of archivists to use XML in archival representation, this assumes EAD will-and should-be cemented as a permanent process. In fact, this development should draw great concern. EAD is now a benchmark for repositories to be satisfied with their online presence: it seems that any EAD display is acceptable and even impressive within the field. Full implementation is highly valued with little concern for utility. Thus, momentum towards maturity may be more of an argument for reexamination rather than blind advancement. We have the example of the MARC standard to warn us to the incredible permanence of a mature standard. Its use has become widespread, yet this prevalence proves it to be incredibly resistant to improvement or change. Such success with EAD may come with similar problems. Through much of its early history, the profession pushed forward with EAD without significant focus on its utility to users. Jihyun Kim offered a relatively early critique of online finding aids, by focusing on the presented content from a user’s point of view. The author took a sample of one random finding aid from the 17 of the 161 institutions of the Research Library group who used EAD. A content analysis was performed that examined variation among the finding aids in five major categories: data elements, labeling terminology, navigational aids, browsing arrangement, and search features. 6 The author’s hypothesis suggests that inconsistencies are detrimental to the utility of EAD finding aids. As she argues, “…variances in local practice result in rendering the EAD finding aids online in diverse ways causing problems for both end users and archivists wanting to create databases of finding aids across repositories.”7 She highlights these irregularities and offers some small suggestions for fixing them. The author separated her five points of examination into three aspects. First, she looked at the use of data elements in online EAD finding aids and their popularity. The most popular tags were physical description (), title proper (), unit title (), and biography or history (), each used 15 or 16 out of a possible 17 times. Jihyun is disturbed that the wide use of both the title proper and unit title tags may lead to redundancy and confusion. The duplication of date () and unit date () drew the same concern. Administrative tags, like access restrictions (), acquisition information (), and preferred citation () enjoyed mixed use and the author laments that the controlled access headings tag () was rarely user. Overall, the findings proved to confirm the supposition that there is significant variation among the use of EAD elements. Jihyun argues that some tags are underutilized - particularly the controlled access headings. This limits the number of access points - what she believes is the greatest utility of EAD. While more access points-as we will discuss-may help users, her faith in subject headings in particular may be misplaced as we will see below. Next, Jihyun looked at interface design, particularly labeling terminology and navigational aids. She found that the language used to label EAD fields for the user to be inconsistent, suggesting that, “Users might be confused if the naming of labeling terminology is not consistent with the content.” 8 She then argues that, since EAD is only a data structure standard, a related data content standard is needed. This problem has since been fixed by the development of Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS), which offers consistent vocabulary for finding aids and is readily transferred to EAD. However, as we shall see, the use of DACS in EAD may have worsened usability issues. For navigation, Jihyun discussed the use of four features: expand/collapse functions, back-and-forth indicators, back-to-top links, and frames. 9 The most common feature was the use of frames - namely to construct navigational link toolbars. This allows both content and context to be displayed in a single window. Expand and Collapse functions were also used in over half of finding aids. This feature allows users to view both higher and lower levels of more complex hierarchies while avoiding irrelevant information from other lower levels. Back-and-forth and back-to-top links were seen less, used in five and two examples respectively. Five EAD finding aids offered no navigational features whatsoever, leading to the display of long narratives and seemingly endless container lists. Jihyun criticizes the lack of navigational utilities, positing that long finding aids by themselves make it difficult to find content and easy to get lost among the countless pages. Finally, the author studied the accessibility of these 17 EAD finding aids from their repositories’ web pages. 16 of the 17 sites offered some sort of inventory of finding aids to browse. These were commonly alphabetical, with ten sites sorting by collection title and five by creator name. One site seems to have offered a variety of ways to sort, such as by repository, date, or collection number. Jihyun bemoans the failure of many of these sites to be explicit in their sorting methods. She then argues that while browsing can be useful, it is a usually time-consuming task-particularly in repositories with a long list of collections-and that searching can be more helpful. Jihyun deems searching, “a growing necessity,” finding that seven out of the 17 sites offer this feature. She discusses the use of delimiters, results displays, and Boolean operators before concluding in general, that, “Even though searching would be an effective way of accessing EAD finding aids, less than half of the sampled web sides provided search functions.” Overall, she discovered that archivists can improve their EAD finding aids by offering more diverse access points, consistent terminology, more navigational aids, explicit browsing features, and search functions. The exploitation of search is the topic of Xiaomu Zhou’s study which again finds the status quo in EAD finding aids to be drastically insufficient. While Xiaomu admits that the EAD structure has had a large impact in the field, she contends that it has not led to the development of useful search functions to improve access. She argues that, “EAD finding aids are in, and of themselves, only one element in enhanced online search systems,” and, “To fully realize the benefit of EAD finding aids, there must be a good underlying search strategy.” In other words, archivists have been satisfied with the mere encoding and presentation of finding aids with EAD - they need to realize that EAD does not promote accessible web pages from a navigational perspective. There must be additional access tools, particularly search functions that enable users to comfortably retrieve content. Xiaomu examines the delivery functions of EAD information systems - particularly search. A content analysis was performed on 58 EAD finding aid delivery systems that were listed by the Library of Congress in December of 2003. The author looked at the types of search engines used, the availability of search options, and the display of search results and criticism was made based on popular Web design theory. Overall, only 45 out of a possible 58 archival web sites offered search functions. A variety of types was represented, such as commercial search engines, freeware search engines, and database-based search. The author discussed each of these offerings in turn with the most features coming from the freeware. Xiaomu argues that search options are the method that most fully exploits EAD’s structure. EAD divides its content by a number of elements, which should allow search engines to filter queries based on certain elements. Unfortunately, only about half of the 45 search functions offered multiple options for searching, and even these were inconsistent in practice. Thus, she concludes that the possible search benefits of EAD are wholly underutilized. Search functions of EAD finding aids receive similar marks on their display of results. The author found that, “Nearly half of the websites with search systems did not organize their retrieval results very well.”10 She argues that archivists must take the design of results display seriously, “…because display really influences the efficiency of the entire system.” 11 The author continued to criticize the lack of advance search features, like feedback for zero results or mobility between search and browsing. Still, these relatively minor features were only represented in about half of search systems. It is clear that search functions of EAD finding aids are not up to snuff. Xiaomu concludes that, “…the functionality of search systems on web sites varied considerable, and the advantages of EAD finding aids for hierarchical searching have not been fully realized. She continues to charge that archivists have focused more on the implementation of EAD than on the delivery of encoded information, as laments that many have outsourced this more important process. While there are certainly feasibility issues here, that does not excuse archivists for being oblivious to the actual delivery of their online content. Anne J. Gilliland-Swetland is perhaps the first critic to the way EAD is being used to present online finding aids. She sees EAD as having the enormous potential to help archivists reexamine archival information systems. In order to deflect opposition to her suggestions she first discusses why finding aids were developed in the traditional format and then shows how EAD aids these purposes. Then, she details some basic requirements of online information systems. Finally, in light of these two discussions she offers ten suggestions to redesign online finding aids. According to Gilliland-Swetland, archival finding aids developed into their current state to serve three primary purposes. First, finding aids served to document provenance and original order and to authenticate the existence of material. This helps makes collections permanent entities and documents changes such as accruals. These concerns led to the finding aid’s hierarchical structure. She details how, “Finding aids proceed from the general-an overview description of a collection-to the specific-a description at the lowest level of analysis, most commonly the file level but potentially the individual document (i.e., item-level)-all while reflecting the native arraignment of the archival materials.”12 EAD can accomplish this and more. She discusses how structure is required, as non-compliant pages will fail to display, and how templates can be used to ensure completeness and consistency. She then lists a number of EAD elements that help authenticate and document by specifying things like accruals () or custodial history (). The archival reference () element in particular allows for even more documentation of contextual linkages than is possible with a paper finding aid. The traditional finding aid was locked into its traditional physical form to ensure authenticity and documentation, but one elements are encoded they can be displayed in different ways whilst still retaining contextual relationships. The traditional finding aid was also developed to be a collections management tool as archivists have long used them to store internal information. In EAD, there are elements for administrative information (), restrictions ( or ), acquisitions information (), and processing information (). These can also be directed to apply to only select material within a collection. In fact, in the traditional format, irrelevant collection management information could confuse users. Now, sensitive or extraneous information may be hidden from user eyes whilst still being available to the archivist. The final function performed by the traditional finding aid was its use as in information discovery and retrieval tool. It has been used for both browsing and known-item searching by both archivists and users. However, Gilliland-Swetland charges that, “Consideration of user needs in terms of effectively carrying out thee activities has not traditionally been factored into the design of the finding aids.”13 She continues to accuse archivists of long describing to their own needs rather than the needs of their users. Thus, finding aids have been long organized primarily by provenance and original order rather than subject. This extensive contextual information is often not valued by users, and when it is-as in the case of academic historians-these users often come prepared. While they still need reassurance of this information, this goal is secondary to finding the content they need. The most common approach is known-item searches, which archivists have not valued. In fact, the author charges that “…the traditional finding aid makes direct, de-contextualized access to archival materials close to impossible.” Description at the lower levels is often the lowest priority even though this level is most important for known-item searching. There are, however, legitimate reasons for finding aids’ insufficiency in information discovery. One is the cost of description at lower levels. Another reason is that archivists have needed create universal access tools that were used to describe a wide range of archival material. Hierarchies have been used in order to simply and easily organize this variable and organic material whilst preserving the original order. Gilliland-Swetland sees the online finding aid as having the immense potential to create an effective information delivery system that is still feasible despite these uniquely archival challenges. She argues that, “The materials-centric and the user-centric approaches can now be simultaneously addressed, if not reconciled, through thoughtful design of EAD-based archival information systems.”14 The piece continues to profile the needs of potential archival user groups in order to make these behaviors readily possible in online finding aids. Academic historians need contextual information, but that requirement is often secondary to discovery. While they require the maintenance of original order, more access points would be helpful. Institutional administrators need to search by subject or perform known-item searches to reference specific materials for content or recall documents for legal use. K-12 teachers now need to use primary source material in the classroom. They need easy access to visual materials at the lower level and the ability to then discern contextual information. Genealogists require administrative histories in order to locate where certain records may be housed. They also need to be able to search and retrieve at the lower level and would be helped by name and date access points. Other features they enjoy are genealogical guides of know people and collaborative web spaces to share their findings. From this discussion Gilliland-Swetland makes ten suggestions for improving online archival information systems. He takes an idealistic approach with little concern for feasibility. This leads to proposals like linking between archival content and full-text secondary material. While her suggestions may be unmanageable, her approach is most valuable. This methodology is the inverse of the development of EAD the thinking of most archivists. The profession has long created inadequate access tools that required mediation by the archivists. In an online environment that intervention is quite difficult. However, that same online environment offers immense potential for archivists to redesign their problematic access tools. Gilliland-Swetland argues that, “In order to exploit the potential of EAD most fully… archivists must look beyond the current intellectual and physical form of the finding aid to a fundamental re-conceptualization of the role of archival metadata with in more inclusive archival information system.” 15 Despite her confidence in it, it is clear that EAD has not led to this change, but has served to continue archival access intransigence into the Internet age. While the profession has long lacked effective user studies of its online EAD finding aids, the resent research of Joyce Celeste Chapman has yielded quite harsh criticism of their utility. She argues that archivists need direct and systematic interaction with users in order to understand their needs. Chapman’s reasoning for this is poignant. She argues that, “As archivists work to refine finding aid web displays, it is important to remember that the goals of descriptive standards should not and do not include display. User needs and the principles of web design, rather than the structure of the EAD XML standard, should dictate how finding aids are displayed.”16 To understand users’ interaction with online EAD finding aids, Chapman performed a usability study for the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. The interaction of twelve participants with online finding aids was examined. This group consisted of six experienced archives users and six novice users. The study asked how users interest and use online displays, how fast are new users able to learn, and what necessary features are missing from online archival information systems?17 The study showed that, understandably, experience in both internet usage and archives helped users successfully navigate finding aids. In fact, internet proficiency was the most important aid to users. The system did little to support known-item searches and users were forced to rely on the bowser search function (ctrl+F) which explained the utility of internet proficiency. Series titles were extensively relied upon and when these titles reflected the format of material rather than “aboutness” users were confounded. Reactions to the experimental navigation features were mixed, but the author offered the hope the some more user-friendly tools may help alleviate the difficulty users have with hierarchies. Neither the novice nor the experienced users saw subject headings as helpful in any sense. Archival terminology without context was confusing to users. In fact, as Chapman states, “Complaints about terminology were one of the largest issues that arose during the study.”18 This calls the role of DACS in online archival information systems into doubt. Despite Jihyun Kim’s calls for a content standard, it seems that this terminology may be detrimental to the usability of online finding aids. Perhaps most importantly, Chapman found that the lack of an in-page search option was extremely problematic to all users. For known-item searches, users prefer immediate search and avoided the large blocks of contextual information that are most prominent in almost all finding aids. In fact, Chapman even found that, “…when a search function is not available, rather than attempt to navigate in any other way some users would rather move up a level in the site’s hierarchy to where there is a search, even though this takes them further from their known goal.” 19 For known-item searching, which makes of a large amount of information needs, search is a life raft to users, and if a finding aid does not supply one they will consider this unacceptable. Chapman’s study is a great start at challenging current online archival information systems with user experiences. From even these relatively small insights into user behavior it is already clear that our archival finding aids are not effective in meeting user wants and needs. The author is correct in asserting that only though the experiences of users can archivists learn the knowledge they need to develop more effective systems that take advantage of the Internet for the profession. In this spirit, J. Gordon Daines III and Cory L. Nimer offer a radical new take on the structure of online archival finding aids. They despair that EAD finding aids, in their current popular form, have, “…created an access barrier to the materials they describe.” 20 Instead, the authors suggest a reevaluation of online archival information systems based on user studies their expectations of search tools. They argue that, “In order to encourage use of our materials, archivists need to employ principles of user-centered design to ensure that our interfaces are transparent and meet our users’ needs.”21 Yet, the authors lament how little progress has been made in interface design since the development of EAD. Online archival finding aids must look and act like most other information systems on the web. New findings from user studies have revealed serious insufficiencies in finding aid interfaces. In order to meet these standards, Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer argue that single-level display-or a discrete web page for each archival level-is necessary. The authors disparage archivists’ unrelinquishing love of document-based displays. This intransigence is furthered by the popularity of Archivist’s Toolkit and ARCHON - both of which, “…have been developed with a document-based view of EAD files.”22 The authors continue to discuss two more obscure collection management tools, PLEADE and ICA-AtoM-the only ones that help to build single-level displays-in an attempt to popularize this approach. Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer have used these critiques of typical online finding aids to offer a radical new take on an archival information system at BYU. All of their pages follow popular Web design principles in that they avoid using large blocks of text and long, scroll-heavy lists. Instead, the necessary contextual information is offered, not at the beginning of the finding aid, but directly next to the content to which it pertains. Their main page emphasizes keyword search, and the advanced search is able to search at the collection, series, sub-series, or file level - or users can select to search only digitized materials that are available online. The information from what was the scope and content note is now spread out and available at the pages of lower levels. The authors succinctly argue that short descriptors at the collection level are actually in accordance with DACS. Some information from the collection level-such as restrictions or repository information-“cascades” down and is again available at lower levels. Archival context is preserves in a scrollable hierarchy window on the right hand side of series-level pages, yet is not the primary navigational focus. The authors conclude that, while this new model is far from perfect, they believe is the step in the right direction. Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer argue that we need to spend less time attempting to educate users on how to use our obscure tools and more time designing self-explanatory online finding aids that follow the same design principles as the rest of the web. Only the creation of easily accessible online archival information systems can we fully exploit the vast potential of the internet to grow the use of archives. Perhaps the best argument Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer make is that encoding gives us the ability to innovate - to relinquish our traditional ways and actually develop useful ways of delivering archival material over the Internet. One can make a few simple and resource-cheap suggestions for online finding aids based on these very significant critiques of current practices. The first is to explain to users that the purpose of an online finding aid is not necessarily to deliver online content. This makes finding aids quite unique in an online environment and users should not be expected to know as much. Perhaps a red or green button could state it that finding aid contains online material or not. The button could link to either a page that details specifically how to find the digitized material or a page that deliberately explains the expense and technical difficulties in providing online content to all materials. The second suggestion is to adopt Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer’s idea of distinct pages for every level of hierarchy above the file level. This, coupled with a left-hand navigation bar will help users to navigate complex hierarchies in a more comfortable fashion. The third suggestion is to spread out the contextual information to the lower levels where it directly applies. The primary scope and content note would be a simple statement that gives a rough description of what the materials are. A link to “more information” brings users to a discrete page which contains that entire scope notes for every level of the collection. This more detailed information will also be offered at the series and subseries levels. Where large amounts of information are needed, bullet points will replace long paragraphs. The forth suggestion is that the containers lists at the series or sub series level, will be collapsible, and in their collapsed form will give not only the container number, but a concise descriptor. This will be particularly useful for alphabetical series. Thus the collapsed containers would read, “Box 34 - Def-Gai,” “Box 35 Gal-Jer,” etc. This will allow for navigation in the collapsed display. The forth suggestion is that archival terminology be given context when there is none. While this may contradict DACS, it is necessary to ensure users understand section titles. Thus, “Provenance” might read “Provenance (origins of material).” While this may be uncomfortable to some archivists, the result would be to better educate users to concepts like provenance. These few minor suggestions should be fairly easy to implement and will make significant strides towards increasing the accessibility of online finding aids. Now, the problem we face is that EAD is only compatible with some of these changes. The solution may be to limit the technical role of EAD to coincide with its intended use. EAD is a data format standard, nothing more. Why is it commonly used for display? Perhaps the primary problem of using EAD to display content is that the interface will always look outdated. Today, many EAD finding aids look as if they are from the late 1990s. This is because general web design makes interface and design advances much faster that the profession can design new XML style sheets. We should treat EAD like a data format standard–like a set of machine-readable fields–and let general HTML manage the interface and display. The HTML interface can be a template that can link to a set EAD file for content. This will allow archivists to continually develop more sophisticated and user-friendly information systems while keeping pace with the general web community. As Daines III &amp;amp; Nimer argue, EAD enables us to innovate, and using EAD to structure online display prevents us from doing just that.
