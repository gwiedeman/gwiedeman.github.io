### Old DACS Priciples, 1-6

1. Records in archives possess unique characteristics
2. The principle of respect des fonds is the basis of archival arrangement and description
3. Arrangement involves the identification of groupings within the material
4. Description reflects arrangement
5. The rules of description apply to all archival materials, regardless of form or medium
6. The principles of archival description apply equally to records created by corporate bodies, individuals, or families
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Old DACS Princples, 7-8


* (7) Archival descriptions may be presented at varying levels of detail to produce a variety of outputs
    * Levels of description correspond to levels of arrangement.
    * Relationships between levels of description must be clearly indicated.
    * Information provided at each level of description must be appropriate to that level.
* (8) The creators of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described.
    </script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Revised DACS Principles, 1-4
    
1. Archival description expresses professional ethics and values
2. Users are the fundamental reason for archival description
3. Archival description must be clear about what archivists know, what they don’t know, and how they know it.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Records, agents, events, and the relationships between them are the four fundamental concepts that constitute archival description.

* Records must be described in aggregate and may be described in parts.
* The relationships among records, agents, and events are essential to understanding archives and must be described. 
* Record creators and other agents must be described sufficiently to fully understand the meaning of records.
* Events that are essential to understanding records must be described. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Revised Principles, 5-7

* (5) Archival description privileges intellectual content in context. Descriptive rules apply equally to all records, regardless of format or carrier type. 
* (6) Each collection within a repository must have an archival description.
* (7) Archivists must have a user-driven reason to enhance existing archival description. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Revised Principles, 8-11

* (8) Archival description should be easy to use, re-use, and share.
* (9) Archival description is accessible and intelligible.
* (10) Archivists must document and make discoverable the actions they take on records.
* (11) Archival description is a continuous intellectual endeavor.

## DACS Principles revision

What do you think?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Extensible Processing in the University Archives

* No Detailed Processing vs. Minimal Processing/MPLP
* Creative approaches to scale are fundamental to archives
* We will never have enough resources
* Late 20th century records are very stable
* Processing is resource management
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Handling Scale with our Principles

* Establishing baseline processing for everything
* User-based reason for adding additional description
    * Request statistics
    * Web usage statistics
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<img src="img/xtfStats.png"/>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### [Yearbook Collection](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ua807)

* No description until 2015
* Second most visited collection page
* Most requested for digitization
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Don't describe containers

* Users don't care what box its in
* Maureen Callahan, "On Containers"
* [https://icantiemyownshoes.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/on-containers/](https://icantiemyownshoes.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/on-containers/)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### [Provost's Office Records](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ua500)

* Only preserve permanent records
* Bulletins are used often
    * Item-level
* Program Registration Letters
    * Item-level
* Program Registration Letters
    * Described as found
    * Ordered description not files
    * Restricted pending review
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### [Division of Research Records](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ua400)

* No real accssion records
* Dates on boxes
* Describe records as found
* No refoldering unless neccessary
* Can now describe [International Programs](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ua550)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Digitization on Demand

Users don't want help finding things, they want help getting things

* Empower users to make requests
* Appraisal by direct use
* Use cheap digitization methods
    * Sheet feeders!
* [Connect digital objects with description](https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/wp988k33r)
    * Metadata is most costly part of digitization
* Bearman & Lytle, "The Power of Provenance"
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Extensible Processing

* Establish minimum level for all collections
* User-based reasons to add description
* "Arrangement is a noun, not a verb"
* Avoid granular preservation interventions in most cases
* Don't describe containers
* Make the robots do the work

What do you think?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Description Exercise

* Apply DACS to your collection
* Read desciption from another group
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### University Archives Collecting

* Formal records management program until cut in 1990s
	* Very effective collecting in 1960s and 1970s
* Records Management "distributed" among offices
* Most permanent records should come to me
* Transfers used to happen during moves, when space needed
	* No longer sufficient
* Misunderstanding of archives and our role
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## SUNY Records Retention

* [SUNY Records Retention and Disposition Schedule](https://system.suny.edu/compliance/records/records-retention/records-retention-schedule/ "SUNY Records Retention and Disposition Schedule")

* [Office of the Senior VP for Academic Affairs and Provost](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ua500)

University records are public records, subject to FOIL <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Records Collecting in Practice

* Files dispersed around the University
    * Boxes and filing cabinets in storage areas
	* Local Computers
	* Network Shares
	* Cloud Storage
	* Different Software Applications
* Files On the Live Web
	* Web crawling
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Prioritizing Born-Digital

* Advantages
    * The master copy in most cases, often only copy
    * Easier to provide access
    * Often comes with more useful creator metadata
    
* Disadvantages
    * Few immediate reasons to manage or transfer
    * Requires long term institutional commitment
    * Cost to develop and implement systems
    * Cost to maintain systems

### Building an Institutional Records Collecting Program

* Avoid unsoliticed donations
* Systematic application of the retention schedule 
    * applied to each department
* Format-neutral practices
* Requires digital infrastructure
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
