Guest lecture for graduate Digital Libraries class on metadata in practice. I focus on serialized metadata outside of systems and stress the importance of metadata standards--and particularly--metadata controls. Students got hands-on experience with some basic metadata practices. I also give some tips for working with metadata and provided a glimpse of the potential for metadata now and in the near future.
