For ArchivesSpace's intergrations webinar series I talk about UAlbany’s integration of ArchivesSpace and ArcLight. UAlbany implemented ArcLight in March 2019 to provide access to archival description. This instance relies on integrations with ArchivesSpace for creating and managing description, and Hyrax for providing access to digital objects. I overview why we chose this direction before briefly diving into the details on how UAlbany’s integration works. Finally, I discuss what still needs to be improved, as well as a look forward at the big picture for archival discovery.
