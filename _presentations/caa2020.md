(With Mark Wolfe) Over the past few years, UAlbany has implemented ArchivesSpace, ArcLight, Hyrax, and a number of other smaller systems. We do a quick demo of how these systems work and overview the choices we made, what is working really well, and what is still a challenge. Then, for most of the session, we have a structured discussion on the role of web systems in archives, the challenges in implementing them, the support needed and finally discuss strategies for communicating needs to stakeholders.
