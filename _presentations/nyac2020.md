This was my talk on archival description aggregation for NYAC 2020 which became virtual due to the COVID-19 crisis. I briefly overview some current archival aggregation efforts and show how archivists have been attempting to aggregate archival description for about 70 years. I suggest that a common data model will help archivists better manage their data outside of specific tools and how we can incorporate ideas from RiC and description theory to thoughtfully make our description more useful.
