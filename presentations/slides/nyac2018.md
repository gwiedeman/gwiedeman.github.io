## Establishing a Collecting Program

* Network Folder Share
	* Archives and creator has access
	* Python script run on task scheduler
	* Weekly checks for new files
	* CSV log files of files transferred
	* Creates XML accession metadata file
	* Runs createSIP.py command line tool
	* Enters line in accessions.xlsx
* Custom scripts for SmugMug and other systems with APIs
* Manual collecting over GoogleDrive

	* No more ad-hoc approaches
	* No more XML data stores
* Network of well-maintained interoperable tools
	* APIs connections
	* Data Models

---

## Introduction to APIs

* [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/)

* <a href="https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/">Wayback Machine API</a>

* [Archive-It](https://partner.archive-it.org/login?next=/archiveit)
* [Page for Crawl](https://partner.archive-it.org/652/collections/6916/crawl/552635)
* [API for Crawl](https://partner.archive-it.org/api/crawl_job/552635?format=json)

---

## ArchivesSpace is the Key

---

## What can you do with ASpace API?

* Fully exploit archival description
* Automate any changes at any scale
	* Data Model makes sure its consistent
* Connect with other systems
* Rely on the community for sustainable code
* [ArchivesSnake](https://github.com/archivesspace-labs/ArchivesSnake) makes it easier

---

## Separation of Concerns: Smaller Tools

* [Find-it](http://libstaff/find-it/index.html)
	* \\\\libstaff\wwwroot\find-it
* [asInventory](https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/asInventory)
	* \\\\LINCOLN\\Library\\SPE Staff\\Greg\\asInventory
* [Box uploader](http://libstaff/find-it/boxes.html)

---

## Data Models!

<!-- .slide: data-background="img/linkedData.png" -->

---

## An Interoperable Repository with APIs

* ArchivesSpace for Managing Metadata
	* Spreadsheet tool
	* Find-it
* Archive-It for Web Archives
* [Hyrax Repository for Digital Storage](http://169.226.92.29:8080/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=)
* [Arclight for Access](http://169.226.92.29/catalog/ua200aspace_0c72d6b94d313b11ddcef771ce8dac46)
* [Make Automatic Connections!](http://169.226.92.29:8080/concern/digital_archival_objects/new?locale=en)

## Things I don't really care about

* File formats
	* identification
	* validation
	* migration for preservation
* Literal interpretation of OAIS
* Compression
* Any micro preservation activity

---

## Things I do care about

* Access

---

## Challenges

* Administering Hyrax Sustainably
* Advocacy and legwork with creators
