## Born-Digital Records at UAlbany

* Building Born-Digital infrastructure
* Making Access Familiar
* Challenges (they're not really technical)

---

## The University Archives

* University Records
	* Office of the President
	* University Senate
	* University Council
	* Provost and Academic Affairs
		* Records of Schools and Colleges
		* Records of Academic Departments
	* Research Centers and Institutes
* Student Groups and Manuscripts
	* Student Association
	* Albany Student Press
	* Faculty and Alumni Papers

---

## Traditional Practices

* Collecting during office moves, when storage areas get crowded

* Call the University Archivist for information

<br/>

Today most permanent records are created digitally<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<br/>

Digital records are easier to make accessible<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

---

## Born-Digital Records Collecting in Practice

* Files On the Live Web
	* Web crawling
* Files dispersed around the University
	* Local Computers
	* Network Shares
	* Cloud Storage (OneDrive)
	* Different Software Applications
	* Private Computers

## Born-Digital Collecting Priorities

1. Automated digital transfers over network storage
2. Web crawling
3. Disk imaging of external media
4. Manual transfer over cloud storage
5. Custom scripts to pull from APIs
6. Paper when maintained as such

---

## Establishing a Collecting Program

<img src="img/recordsCollecting1.png"/>

---

## Transfer Scripts

* Network Folder Share
	* Archives and creator has access
* Python script run on task scheduler
* Weekly checks for new files
* CSV log files of files transferred
* Creates XML accession metadata file
* Runs createSIP.py command line tool
* Enters line in accessions.xlsx
* Manual collecting over GoogleDrive

## Current Access System

* [University Senate Records](http://meg.library.albany.edu:8080/archive/view?docId=ua200.xml)
* [Luna DAMS](http://luna.albany.edu/luna/servlet/s/pppxob)
* [Digital Media Department](http://meg.library.albany.edu:8080/archive/view?docId=ua395.xml)

---

## Maintenance

* Scripts break over time
	* No more ad-hoc approaches
	* No more XML data stores
* Network of well-maintained interoperable tools

---

## Things I don't really care about

* File formats
	* identification
	* validation
	* migration for preservation
* Literal interpretation of OAIS
* Adherence to format or structure standards
* Compression
* Any micro preservation activity

---

## Things I do care about

* Automation/scale
* Description/content standards
* Maintenance
* Documentation
* Access

---

## Introduction to APIs

* [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/)

* <a href="https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/">Wayback Machine API</a>

* [Archive-It](https://partner.archive-it.org/login?next=/archiveit)
* [Page for Crawl](https://partner.archive-it.org/652/collections/6916/crawl/552635)
* [API for Crawl](https://partner.archive-it.org/api/crawl_job/552635?format=json)

---

## ArchivesSpace is the Key

<img src="img/aspaceCenter.png"/>

---

## What can you do with ASpace API?

* Automate any changes at any scale
	* Data Model makes sure its consistent
* Connect with other systems
* Develop interoperable workflows
* Rely on the community for sustainable code
* [ArchivesSnake](https://github.com/archivesspace-labs/ArchivesSnake) makes it easier

---

## Separation of Concerns: Smaller Tools

* [Find-it](http://libstaff/find-it/index.html)
	* \\\\libstaff\wwwroot\find-it
* [asInventory](https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/asInventory)
	* \\\\LINCOLN\\Library\\SPE Staff\\Greg\\asInventory
* [Box uploader](http://libstaff/find-it/boxes.html)


---

## An Interoperable Repository with APIs

* ArchivesSpace for Managing Metadata
	* Spreadsheet tool
	* Find-it
* Archive-It for Web Archives
* [Hyrax Repository for Digital Storage](http://169.226.92.29:8080/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=)
* [Arclight for Access](http://169.226.92.29/catalog/ua200aspace_0c72d6b94d313b11ddcef771ce8dac46)
* [Make Automatic Connections!](http://169.226.92.29:8080/concern/digital_archival_objects/new?locale=en)

## API Access Allows Maintainable Workflows


<img src="img/apiWorkflow.png"/>

---

## Open, Interconnected Workflows

1. Detect accession
2. Get contextual data from ArchivesSpace API
4. Ingest into digital repository
5. Que for review 
6. Expose data into central search index

---

## Make Access Familiar

* Discoverable alongside paper records
* In context with upper level Archival Description
* Purpose of website is to access paper and digital records
* Demonstrate value to campus and outside donors
* Computational access to collections data
	* Researchers use APIs too
	* Rights for this part of EAD and DACS

---

## The Problems are not Technical

* Technical Literacy
	* Data modeling
	* User Experience Design (UX)
* Resources demands
	* Use extensible processing
* System Administration and *minimal* custom development
	* Staffing and administration problem
	* Programmer-Archivists is not a good solution
* Demonstrate Value
	*  Chicken and Egg problem

---

## Strengths

* Community
* Openness
