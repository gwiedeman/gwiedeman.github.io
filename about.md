This is a place to put some of the things I'm working on. I am currently the [University Archivist at the University of Albany, SUNY](https://library.albany.edu/archive/).

I focus on collecting documentation of the university and making it available for research use. I get to solve problems with paper records and legacy digital records, work with metadata at scale, and create ways to make a lot of content available on the web.

I do a ton of work with Python, Rails, APIs, obsolete digital formats, and web technologies. I also manage the department's ArchivesSpace instance, [ArcLight access system](https://archives.albany.edu/description/), and [Hyrax digital repository](https://archives.albany.edu/catalog).

I have a research background in 19th century American History and did some work on how people understood faraway places, particularly the Eastern Mediterranean.

This is not totally a blog, but a place to share things I've [written](/writing), [spoken about](/presentations), or [coded](/code). I also have some plans to write stuff here that's not really suitable for publication.
